I declare the period of sessions of the European Parliament , interrupted on May 26 , 2005 , to be resumed .
Some 15 years ago , the European Parliament awarded the Sakharov Prize to the leader of the Burmese opposition , Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi .
She will celebrate her 60th . birthday within a few days , that is to say , that four times 15 years have passed , but she is still detained .
She is the only Sakharov laureate who has not been able to receive her prize after more than 3,500 days in captivity .
It is appropriate to remember this , because it may have been forgotten .
It may have been forgotten that in 1990 , the National League for Democracy , obtained 80 % of the votes , but she could not take power because of the Burmese military regime .
And , in spite of the frequent and constant calls from this Parliament , in spite of the European Union sanctions , in spite of the condemnation of various bodies from the United Nations , the Burmese regime continues with its campaign for ethnic cleansing and abuse of human rights in a systematic fashion .
Human Rights Watch recently accused this regime of the systematic violation of human rights , tortures and executions .
This is why we believe , on behalf of this Parliament , that it is opportune for all of us to renew our call for the release of Aung San Suu Kyi and her political-prisoner companions and that we express our strongest condemnation of the abuses of the Burmese regime .
The definitive outline for the agenda of the plenary session of June , as this was set out at Presidents' Conference of Wednesday June 2 , last , pursuant to sections 100 and 131 of the Regulations has been distributed .
The following modifications have been proposed for this :
Wednesday : The socialist Group requested the questions session to the Council be dispensed with .
Would anyone care to explain the request from the socialist Group ?
It means , not that the questions session be dispensed with , but rather its duration be reduced by half an hour .
Many thanks , Mr. Cohn-Bendit ; we don 't know who Mr. Poettering has consulted with , but it is as well to amend it .
What is clear is Mr. Poettering 's proposal and that he asks for the wording of the agenda to be modified .
( The wording of the point in question is modified )
At any rate , the important thing will not be the wording of the heading , but rather the content of the discussion .
As you know , the agenda has not been dispensed with , but rather its duration has been reduced .
You don 't like this and I understand that , but most of the Chamber has supported this with their votes , and we are not contradicting the Regulations , but rather we are applying them .
We will move on to the session for speeches in a minute .
Let me tell you this is the first time that we are going to deal with this agenda , after you having received the President 's letter where you were told in what way to think about organising setting it out .
There has not even been one member who has raised any objection in this respect , but I suppose that you have full knowledge of what this letter tells you , and I will then proceed to apply what you expected of it , that is , to give priority to the members who have made a written request to speak beforehand , stating the subject they would like to talk about .
This has specifically been done by thirty one members , whom I am going to give priority to at this session of speeches .
Mr. President , I address the meeting , with the mandate of Messrs . Pittella , Yáñez and Madeira , in order to object to the discrimination that Asturias , Murcia , Melilla , Ceuta , Basilicata and Algarve have been the subject of in the document from Mr. Juncker .
The Acting President of the Council made a perceptive speech following the French referendum .
He believes that the politicians should have made their decisions popularly understood and reacted .
We specifically ask this from you for these six European regions : so as to prevent injustice and marginalisation with regard to others that are in the same circumstances .
Mr. Juncker , in your next document , you must do away with the precedent of marginalising three million citizens .
This is a question of dignity , of making European politics comprehensible , of making it egalitarian and democratic , faithful to its roots and its ambitions .
Mr. Juncker , we have confidence in you .
No , Mr. Mote , I have not received it .
Mr. President , it is several months now since we received very concerning news from Sudan , and specifically from Darfur .
We are faced with a crisis that we can 't see a way out of , that some have assessed as being genocide . At any rate , there are thousands of dead and thousands of refugees , in a horrible scenario of the violation of human rights and huge catastrophe .
One of the latest pieces of news to reach us talks about the arrest of two supervisors from Medicins Sans Frontieres , the British man Foreman and the Dutchman Hoedt , accused of espionage and spreading false information .
In particular , the allegedly false report acknowledges over 500 cases of rape of women in Darfur .
I believe the report is significant ; the Medicins Sans Frontieres organization has standing and credibility that can be substantiated and , therefore , this all constitutes one further call for Parliament to also take action in defence of these two Medicins Sans Frontieres supervisors .
Through my intermediation , several colleagues from the Socialist Group have sought a form of process , perhaps a letter from the President to the Sudanese authorities , expressing Parliament 's concern about what has been reported and asking for the release of Messrs . Foreman and Hoedt without charges .
I believe that it is good to implement the Treaty in all its respects .
The rules in force establish where and how this Parliament meets and our obligation is to comply with the regulations in force , whatever they say about the venue that the European Parliament meets .
We have completed this point of the agenda .
The next point is the debate about the Report from Anne Laperrouze , on behalf of the Industry , Research and Energy Commission , regarding the proposal arising from the Decision of the European Parliament and from the Council whereby certain guidelines are set out concerning trans-European networks in the energy sector and by which the Decisions No. 96/391 / EC and no. 1229/2003 / EC ( COM ( 2003 ) 0742 - C5-0064/2004 - 2003/0297 ( COD ) ) ( A6-0134/2005 ) are repealed .
Madam President , the first thing I would like to do is to congratulate Mrs. Laperrouze and thank her for the spirit of cooperation that she has maintained during the undertaking of this report .
The significance of this proposal is based on the fact that developing interconnections is a necessary condition for the creation of a true internal market in the energy field .
Furthermore , interconnections will make it possible to cope , with greater guarantees , with the situational circumstances of the shortfalls in the electricity supply .
As has been said , following the informal three-way dialogue with the Council and the Commission , it was not possible to reach an agreement with Parliament on the first reading .
We do not share the Council 's intention to do away with projects of European interest and we support the maintaining of these categories of projects defended by the speaker .
We also support the amendment by the speaker that modifies the wording regarding the role of the European coordinator , maintaining the approval in the Commission on Industry , Research and Energy , in such a way that the coordinator is appointed for those projects that demonstrate difficulties and that Parliament is to be consulted when it comes to appointing the coordinator . This is something that was approved in the case of the trans-European transport networks .
I would also like to point out one very significant amendment , submitted and approved at the Commission on Industry , Research and Energy ,
This deals with a new point 2 bis , which contains the goals framed at the European Council of Barcelona , by which electrical connections between the members states could reach 10 % of the installed generation capacity .
And , to finish , it just remains for me to applaud the Regulations proposal of the Commission , which is being debated , on the financing of trans-European transport and energy networks .
For the first time , this proposal is considering the co-financing of projects in the energy field and not just the preliminary studies .
I trust that this will be taken into account when it comes to setting the financial forecasts for the period 2007-2013 because , if the budgetary provision is reduced , this and all of the European Union programmes , such as Rural Development , Life , Trans-European Networks and the Seventh Research Framework Programme , will be negatively affected .
Madam President , above all , I would like to thank Mrs. Rothe and all the alternative speakers who have taken part in the preparation of this report for their willingness to look for common ground .
As always , it has been a pleasure to work with colleagues who are so constructive and reasonable .
As Mrs. Rothe has already explained , during the course of a long negotiation , we have managed to reach a satisfactory agreement about this Directive proposal .
In my opinion , this commitment has demonstrated the great significance that all of us who have taken part in the discussion have agreed on the topic of energy efficiency , as well as there being substantial coincidence on the goals of the piece of legislation .
In effect , the security of storage and compliance with the goals that we have set for ourselves in relation to climate change , without overlooking those arising from the Lisbon Agenda , compels us to make a multi-dimensional focus on energy policy .
It seems relevant to me to point out the necessary balance between the setting of general European goals , which are ambitious and realistic , and their flexible adaptation to the specific conditions of each member state .
It is fair to recognise that some countries have made considerable efforts in the past , which have been translated into undeniable improvements in energy efficiency . These achievements should be acknowledged when it comes to deciding on the goals that must be fulfilled .
It is also important to make it clear that the ultimate aim of this Directive is not exclusively to reduce consumption . This is because in some countries where there is a considerable contribution from free sources of emissions it is possible to perfectly-well envisage a more flexible form of focus , one that is better adjusted to their economic growth needs .
Madam President , it pleases me to reiterate the satisfaction of my Group about the new progress made in this goal , which is wanted by everyone , of combining safe supply , protection of the environment and the competitiveness of the economy of the Union in the global market .
Mr. President , today is indeed an important day .
This global debate once more places Parliament at the political forefront of the fight against terrorism .
We are a political chamber and this is a political debate about the European measures that must be taken to defend human rights and defeat terrorism , and a debate whose intention is also to undertake democratic pedagogy .
We are convinced that in order to be effective in the fight against terrorism , Europe must also have a common policy on this subject that goes beyond the increasingly close and more effective cooperation between the countries of the Union -of which Spain and France are a good example- and of the Union with third countries . It is a policy that provides a response to the concerns of the citizens and that could be promoted as a model throughout the world .
Defeating terrorism firstly requires having confidence in the supremacy of democracy .
Defeating terrorism requires being willing to use all of the elements of the Rule of Law , all of them - but not one more than the Rules of Law provides us with .
Defeating terrorism requires combating impunity and cancelling out the legitimating of terrorist acts .
Defeating terrorism means keeping the memory of the victims alive in the memory and in the heart .
Terrorism , colleagues , is totalitarianism , is fanaticism .
Terrorism seeks to destroy free and plural societies .
Terrorism is incompatible with democracy .
This is why I assert that only a strong , vigorous and committed democracy will be able to defeat it .
We have been on more than one occasion in the forefront on this topic in this Chamber .
This is where two recommendations were approved on September 6th 2001 , days before the Twin Towers were demolished  : the detention and handover order and the common definition of the offence of terrorism . It was possible for these to be adopted by the Council in December of that same year thanks to the fact that we , the European Parliament , had done our duty on time .
It is true that there are some countries of the Union that have not yet transposed these into their legislations , and others that have not done it properly .
This is why the request for an urgent evaluation is made in the report , which I am the spokesman for . But these two decisions are an example of how many European citizens need a Parliament capable of placing itself at the forefront of political decisions .
Europe is a model of democracy and of respect for human rights .
This is our vocation , this is the sense of our political Union .
This is why , in order to defend and promote democracy , to guarantee respect for human rights , we fight against terrorism , because we know that terrorism is the enemy of democracy .
For this reason , we are proposing a European policy that combats terrorism in order to respect collective and individual human rights , the right to life , to the freedom of expression , to the freedom of movement , to ideological freedom or religious freedom  : a European policy that fights against terrorism so as to make collective security compatible with freedom and individual dignity .
I am not going to tire you with the details of each one of the report 's recommendations .
These are all pioneering recommendations , but they are all possible .
It only requires political will and all of these are necessary .
They range from the strengthening of the role of the European coordinator for the fight against terrorism to the drive for the creation of the role of a European prosecutor .
I would like to highlight the recommendation for the European recognition for the victims of terrorism to be institutionalised .
Our commitment to promote the international definition of the offence of terrorism is also politically relevant . This is something which is increasingly necessary if , as Kofi Annan proposed in the Madrid Agenda , we want these crimes to be prosecuted and punished throughout the world .
Finally , I would like to draw your attention to a truly ambitious recommendation  : the request of the member states that promote the non-applicability of statutory limitations for offences of terrorism , in this way expressing the reproach of the international community , for what are considered to be amongst the most serious and unacceptable crimes against humanity .
To conclude dear colleagues , I know that it is a small step that we take today but it is an important one .
And I feel proud to have contributed towards the European Parliament once again having placed itself at the head of the struggle against the impunity of criminals and at the forefront of the defence of human rights .
I would like to thank my colleagues , from all political groups , for their contributions to this long debate .
Thanks to all of these , this Chamber is going to propose proactive initiatives to the Chamber that could change the dynamic of the past .
The aim of this set of initiatives is to design a European policy capable of acting in order to prevent terrorist attacks , within what is possible .
I also feel proud as a socialist , as a Basque , as a Spaniard and as a European , that this Parliament is making a new recognition to the memory of the victims of terrorism .
The President of the Government of Spain , José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , again confirmed his commitment , last Saturday , at an event for the awarding of diplomas to the Civil Guard , by asserting that all victims will always be in our memories .
For all democrats , this commitment to the effective remembering of victims , is one which should make it impossible to have a society like the one that the terrorists have sought with their crimes .
Europe knows about totalitarianism and knows about the importance of keeping memories alive so as to stop history repeating itself .
Primo Levi explained this very well to us in a magnificent book .
" Understanding -Levi said- is impossible , but knowing is necessary and remembering is a duty " .
Mr. President , I would like firstly to give thanks for the presence of Commissioner Frattini in the morning today , and to the coordinator of the anti-terrorist struggle of the Council , Mr. Gijs de Vries .
At the same time , I would also like to show my thanks to all of the Euro-members who have worked and cooperated , on some occasions from the standpoint of disagreement and other times agreeing , on this report on the prevention of and response to terrorist attacks and I would very particularly like to thank my good friend , Rosa Díez and my good friend Antoine Duquesne for their assistance and the contributions that they have made to this report .
In these few short minutes I would like to sum up briefly and especially summarise the reasons and objectives that have compelled me to present this report to the European Parliament today .
What have I tried to contribute with this report in this institution  ?
To put it simply , the little that I have been able to learn , my limited and modest experience in what it has meant to be involved in the fight against a terrorist organization for over twenty-five years in my country , Spain , and in the Basque Country .
For this reason , I think that the most significant thing today is for us to go back to the traditional way of fighting terrorism in the European Union , which is usually through a thorough list of measures in which , I consider , there must be a European political project .
You may ask me what the difference is between a thorough list of measures and a political project .
I will tell you that a political project is much more ambitious than a list of measures .
A political project is always the fruit , the consequence , of a priority , of a time , and above all , of the proper and correct mental approach .
And above all , a political project has the capacity to be summarised and understood simultaneously by a form of public opinion that understands the effort that a politician makes to turn this list of measures into a political project .
Let me tell you that the latest results in Europe confirm to us that we need a limited number of political projects , because political projects cannot be infinite .
There must have been few political projects that have been understood by European citizens and capable of tackling the problems of Europeans .
And , in my opinion , terrorism is one of these .
Terrorism cannot be combated in a generic way .
The security bodies and forces cannot adopt a generic mental approach to fighting terrorism .
The fight is against a type of terrorism , a particular organization .
It is true that it is always necessary to fight with the same principles of liberty , of respect for human rights , of what Europe means . However , in any event , we must know how to identify a specific , particular political project . We must always know how to specify , determine and tackle the organization that is being fought against . This is because , amongst other matters as I stated before , this is the only way to stimulate the security bodies and forces so that , when they do combat an organization , they possess and bring all their possible energy against it .
What is a terrorist organization 's main ally  ?
Its diffuse nature : we never know where it begins and where it ends ; we never know which social structure it is based on , or which States are , on occasions , behind this group .
But it always has social support , and one of the keys for combating the terrorist phenomenon is knowing how to specify and set limits on how far the organization reaches , what is the social mesh that supports it .
This is why - and I regret some amendments in this direction - , I regret that we have not dared to call the organization that Europeans are facing , whether it is an Islamic , radical body or a defender of Islam , or Al Qaeda , by its name .
It is fundamental to call it by its name , because this is the only way of combating an organization  : we are less capable of saying what we have facing us in the European Union , at these times .
The main risk that the European Union has is paralysis , inaction , being clear about its principles , its values , being substantially in agreement , and yet not making a common European political project to tackle this great issue that is going to affect the present and the future , and which seems to be someone else 's problem  : The North Americans had this on September 11 , a few years ago , or specifically Spain has had this , for some particular reasons , last March 11 , but in my opinion this is not what we ought to do .
In short , in memory of the victims and stating that they should always be at the centre of our debate , in the focus of our main attention , I again repeat that on this subject , we have all of the moral strength with them so as to take on this issue , which is so fundamental for our future , at its roots .
Mr. President , in this very short speech , I would like to underline the significance of the exchange of information for fighting against this type of terrorism that we are referring to .
This is why Mr. Duquesne 's report is so right in putting the emphasis on this crucial issue .
We have to dare to call out the name of the organization that we are fighting against and we are , without a doubt , faced with a series of fundamentalist groups that do not come from Islam , but which say that they defend Islam .
This is the reason why I believe that this information is so important , because this is an emerging phenomenon that we know almost nothing about , and with this type of phenomenon , information is essential .
There is no doubt we do not have knowledge of its way of working and , above all , we do not know its sense of time .
They are not like other organizations , which have a sense of time like ours .
This is why it is so important that we are able to work on the knowledge of the social support of these organizations , knowing that they are capable of dying and of sacrificing their lives in these attacks , something that does not happen with other types of organizations .
This is why it is so important that we know how to put the emphasis on the exchange of information of the particular national police forces and not just with Europol .
The European project must have sufficient ability to assist the exchange of information between national police forces , which are the ones that are particularly working on this phenomenon .
This is why the Council , the Commission and this Parliament has to create the largest number of forums for exchanging information between all of the police forces that are working on this delicate and difficult issue .
Mr. President , Mr. Commissioner , at this time , fighting against terrorism , preventing it and wiping it off the face of the Earth must constitute the sole priority objective of the policies of this European Union .
We must never forget March 11 , when Spain and Europe were cowardly and cruelly attacked for representing the paradigm of the freedoms which , from this Chamber , we are always seeking to safeguard .
That day , March 11 , changed the history of Spain , of Europe , and with it , of the European Union .
From that time , it has been necessary to recognise that terrorism is not a standard , homogenous or monolithic reality .
On the contrary , that attack demonstrated that there are many types of terrorism existing . Hence , the measures to fight against the different types of terrorism must not be generic , but must rather be specific and adjusted to each one of them .
For this reason , the terrorism of Al Qaeda is not fought against in the same way as the terrorism of ETA or the terrorism of the IRA .
And , of course , we cannot fight by denying its existence , as some colleagues here do , in the European Parliament , eliminating any mention of Al Qaeda in the documents against terrorism of this European Parliament .
If there is a lesson that I have learned from history it is that he who denies is condemned to repeat it .
In order for our fight to be effective , we must base our efforts on mechanisms of protection , and I agree with the Commissioner completely .
The fight must not be exclusively based on the mechanisms of reaction ; it is clear that the best way to fight these is to prevent them .
This form of prevention , and I agree completely with Mr. Mayor Oreja , must be based on the bilateral and swift exchange of information between the specialist services of the member states , in facilitating the systematic transfer of information to Europol and to Eurojust , and in the creation of a record of European convicts , which assist the investigation work .
No difficulty must stand in the way of the effective protective of liberty and the right to life .
The defence of life and liberty must always be our priorities in this struggle .
Mr. President , the debates that we are concerned with is very important and I would like to start by congratulating the speakers , in particular my colleagues , Mr. Mayor Oreja and Mrs. Díez González , for their reports .
Mrs. Díez Gonzalez 's report , in particular , is one of great ambition and seeks to place the level of protection of citizens against terrorism at a very high level .
I believe that one of the tasks of the modern State has been the protection of citizens against any type of criminality .
At these times , we find ourselves with a very specialised form of criminality , terrorism , and this requires not just action from the State institutions , but also cooperation in the international field .
As far as this concerns us , I believe that cooperation in the context of European institutions is fundamental and , in this respect , I would like to recall the importance that the swift ratification of the European Constitution has for the citizens of Europe . This is because it establishes a framework for the fight against terrorism that begins with the recognition , as a fundamental right , of the right to life and to the physical integrity of individuals , and continues with the codification of a space for liberty , security and justice .
It is appropriate to read these texts - it seems that some citizens of the Union do not yet know them .
The solidarity clause of article I-43 of the European Constitution establishes that " The Union and its Member States shall act jointly in a spirit of solidarity if a Member State is the object of a terrorist attack or the victim of a natural or man-made disaster . "
It further states that " The Union shall mobilise all the instruments at its disposal , including the military resources made available by the Member States , to :
a ) - prevent the terrorist threat in the territory of the Member States ;
- protect democratic institutions and the civilian population from any terrorist attack ;
- assist a Member State in its territory , at the request of its political authorities , in the event of a terrorist attack ;
b ) assist a Member State in its territory , at the request of its political authorities , in the event of a natural or man-made disaster .
Moreover , the European Constitution establishes a mechanism for cooperation between the Member States .
So , my conclusion , Mr. President , is that at this time , the citizens of Europe are expecting from us , from European politicians , that we can press for the process of ratification of the European Constitution so that we can soon have the right tools for fighting against this blemish .
Mr. President , my first words are to thank the six speakers , who have taken on a very complicated job in the hard task of fighting against terrorism , of producing a common reflection for combating terrorism , from the point of view of legality and from the respect for human rights and data protection .
I congratulate , by name and surname , Rosa Díez , Jaime Mayor , Stavros Lambrinidis , Antoine Duquesne , Mario Borghezio and Alexander Nuno Alvaro .
My speech has to do with the substantiated commitment , one which is humble but firmly substantiated , in the fight against terror and in the extent and the protection of the victims .
Mr. President , the victims must be heard , must be listened to , must be respected and must be protected , and all of this must be carried out with resources .
There are no concessions to terror .
Terror crimes have no statute of limitations and must be persecuted in any part of the world .
But , Mr. President , driven by my commitment to the victims , I have submitted an amendment to Mr. Borghezio 's report : no. 4 , which has to do with the forms of financing terrorism .
In my country there is a so-called " revolutionary tax " demanded by the ETA terrorist organization .
This is the biggest form of extortion known to the European Union ; it is a form of extortion that consists of writing to Basque businessmen and asking them to finance their criminal and delinquent activities .
It is considered that this form of financing runs to about twelve or fifteen million euros per annum .
Were this to be short-circuited and made impossible , the terrorist gang could not survive .
There are three types of reactions to this phenomenon : those who pay , those who leave the country and those who do not pay and who find it very costly .
The National Court has held cases and trials for these offences .
This is why , this morning , I particularly look to and beg Mrs. Roure to take what I am saying into consideration , because the support of the second largest Group of the Chamber and the rest of its groups is important .
I ask them and earnestly beg them to accept and support this amendment , which I would be willing to modify using other terms that would be easier to take on board , such as " form of extortion that the ETA terrorist organization calls a revolutionary tax " , for example . But I am speaking here about solidarity with Basque businessmen and with Spanish businessmen that undergo and suffer this form of extortion .
Finally , Mr. President , and I conclude with this , I would like to say to Mr. Gijs de Vries : the threat remains .
And Mr. de Vries , who knows that the threat remains , must have the resources necessary not just to make strategic reports , but also to have an office that can effectively combat terror .
Mr. President , I am not sure whether I am speaking on behalf of the ALDE Group or on my own account -I rather think I am speaking for myself .
In any event , it is clear that this is a significant debate .
Several reports are brought to this Chamber today , each one of these having its own particular course in commission which , as a whole , give quite a full picture of the importance that this Parliament attributes to this debate .
These are reports for which those who present them are to be congratulated . It is also necessary to congratulate those who have been capable of understanding the need to accept a large number of amendments which have enhanced and have qualified , in some cases in a very significant way , some of the statements that the original texts make .
In any event , the commitment of this Parliament to the fight against terror will be clear today , being completely overwhelming in terms of the police and legal effectiveness . However , at the same time , is tremendously respectful towards human rights , data protection , and without these guarantees this fight against terrorism does not make sense . This is a fight that takes account of the victims of terrorism , taking them into account from the viewpoint of respect - evidently the political decision is not put in their hands , that is not their job , but it does logically correspond that they have a voice and are directly listened to . This , without justifying terrorism or those who blow themselves up or are capable of indiscriminately murdering in any way , without justifying this under any circumstances , is an anti-terrorist policy that tackles the causes that could enable someone to become a terrorist .
We say that terrorists are born as if they come straight from Mars .
There are situations that lead to some people being willing to kill , and this does not exempt the people who do it from responsibility , but it does compel us , as political leaders , to examine why , which specific situations are behind this form of behaviour .
Therefore , this balance with the overwhelmingly struggle , this examination of reality as it is , the respect for human rights , all of this is a genuine balance which could lead to significant results , if these reports become political action .
There are some active amendments , and one which I have submitted myself on behalf of my Group - of which I would like to fundamentally highlight two .
Firstly , we are taking about terrorism of multiple roots and so , we mention Islam , even though this solely to " look , Islam as it is in its base , seems good to us , but we are worried about the Islamic terrorists " is mixing terrorism with Islam .
Thus , we propose the deletion of all references to Islam in this document , because otherwise we could end up making a list of those who are potential terrorists .
We have not done this , and this would be very dangerous because we would always leave someone out .
Therefore , we do not mix terrorism and Islam together , even though this is only to put in a clause that says " at base , Islam is good " , which is what these reports seek to do if this amendment is not approved .
Secondly , we will propose the deletion of all references to the International Criminal Court .
We believe that this is just starting up , and its functioning would be complicated by a debate on the competence of anti-terrorist measures that would only be detrimental to its function .
We therefore leave this debate outside what concerns us today , since it has its own route , and we will deal with what is working today .
Finally , I would like to tell Mr. Gijs de Vries , that we have the honour of having amongst us how important it is to transform all of this political action , and in terms of specific measures .
Following the agenda , we move on to the debate of the Reimer Böge report , on behalf of the temporary commission on Political Challenges and Budgetary Measures of the Enlarged Union ( 2007-2013 ) , dealing with the political challenges and budgetary measures of the enlarged Union ( 2007-2013 ) [ 2004/2209 ( INI ) ] ( A6-0153/2005 )
Although this may not seem to be the case , this is a case of huge significance for the future of the Union .
Mr. President , the proposal from the European Commission represented a commitment to enlargement and , at the same time , to the aspirations of transforming our economy into a polar of growth and development , overcoming the technological gap with the United States , increasing our presence in the world and taking on the challenges that are raised for us by terrorism and organised crime .
This is in spite of the fact that the distribution of costs deriving from the enlargement that is proposed is neither just nor fair , as we have set out throughout the course of this parliamentary debate , and this is why we have presented an amendment , which I hope will receive the majority support of the Chamber tomorrow .
Thus , without detracting from the praises for the effort that the Luxembourg presidency is making , I cannot help but express my concern for the way in which some of the proposals are running , which aim at making the Member States that maintain a more stagnating attitude happy , to the detriment of others .
The Council would do well to deal with some of the points that are clearly being indicted to it by the European Parliament , in particular the membership policy .
We would like to have a sufficient volume of funds , we would like to have the re-use of surplus funds from the convergence objective of the countries that have the greatest capacity for absorption , and I hope that tomorrow we will approve an amendment that requires political compensation for these countries and regions that suffer a sharp loss in funds .
The fine words of Mr. Schmit , which we are doubtless thankful for , have to be translated into a commitment for cohesion .
And looking at this realistically , I feel that we all agree that at this stage of the Union , we are lacking political leadership . However , what will be tested on the 17th . of next month is the capacity of the Heads of State and Government to take on their responsibility .
And it would be hugely irresponsible for the Council not to specifically reach an agreement at this time .
Mr. President , as is usual in this house , I would like to start by congratulating Mr. Böge for the work carried out in his important report about the political challenges and the budgetary resources for the Union , 2007-2013 .
I will firstly make the following general considerations  :
Without any doubt , the financial outlooks that are referred to in the report place us in a negative situation , both in political and in economic and social terms , in different Member States , and I can do no more than regret--forgive me the expression --that the debate in commission has been poisoned from the start , with this debate focusing on seeking to find an agreement about percentages between the Commission and the Council .
There has sometimes even been a squabble about percentages , net payers , net balances .
I feel that this is a fake debate , from the economic point of view , because it is slanted ; and it is politically even more slanted , because the European Union is not , by a long way , its budget .
Citizens are asking us more than a mere accounting exercise , because the Union should be a whole political scheme , a vision for its citizens and a future amongst twenty-five countries , which means more than being reduced to contributors .
I regret that the current political situation has not allowed Parliament to be more audacious . This is the first time that the Parliament , in its proposal , has been left behind the Commission .
However , having said that , the Socialist Group will support the Böge report , since most of its content contains its fundamental claims .
It firstly welcomes the cohesion policy as an essential tool for promoting territorial , economic and social cohesion , and for reducing the disparities between the regions of the Union - the policy of solidarity par excellence- taking account of the proper financing level of 0.41 % of the NBR as a sine qua non condition .
Secondly , it places the political and social agenda as a priority and recognises that its proper financing is crucial and , accordingly , it seeks an increase of two hundred million so as to able to attain its goals .
Thirdly , it insists on the need for a level of financing that is enough for the external measures , with the aim of the Union becoming an authentic global spokesman .
And finally , it contains the long-standing claim from the European Parliament to integrate the European Development Fund within its general budget .
The Socialist group supports this balanced and realistic resolution , because we are aware that only a majority position of unity makes the Parliament strong with respect to the Council .
The ball is in the Council 's court . It should further take note of the fact that for the Socialist Group , the report is a basic minimum for guaranteeing the sufficiency of resources for European policies amongst the Twenty-Five .
Mr. President , I would like to acknowledge the tenacity of Mr. Böge in carrying out an exercise which is so hard to balance or financially engineer on the first occasion on which , in the history of financial forecasts , the European Parliament has voluntarily limited its direct ambitions for a proposal , even if it is minimal , from the Commission .
Only the opportunity to provide a swift , fair and just decision , which clears up the doubts and uncertainties at this time , could justify us .
This is how we would like to interpret the reconciliatory words of the Commission and to encourage the acting President of the Council to achieve this .
All in all , I am not pacified by the Parliament being set up with a minimalist trend which it already began with the last Agenda 2000 , and which has not contributed towards providing more confidence for European citizens .
I am referring to the risk of the re-nationalising re-ployment of the budget and to making the goals of the Union conditional on the basis of insufficient resources .
We regret the pressure that has been involved with the initial proposal from six Member States , some of which as a whole can more than readily be understood , but there are others that fail to explain the added value of every euro spent sufficiently well , and the strong economic and trading relation that they obtain from the development of the Union .
We regret that 1 % have replaced ideas with percentages , but have also on the other hand , slowed down the discussion about the urgency of reviewing the basis of the system of own resources .
What we do not share is the view that the spokesman applies exclusively to the co-financing of the CAP , who still seeks to digest the latest reform of the latest Brussels reform  : we are not going to throw our farmers into the irrigation water .
We welcome the endeavour to maintain the quota for the cohesion policy , as well as the re-enforcing of social policies of growth and employment , and also those dealing with the justice and foreign policy of the Union .
We would ask the speaker to extend the facing-out logistics mechanism , since he already recognises the regions affected by the enlarging effect of the enlargement , and how this applies to the Cohesion Fund .
The European Parliament has already defended the Agenda 2000 , and now we do not understand that , this being applied by the acting Presidency of the Council , this is not being applied by the Parliament .
We would also like to ask the speaker to accept the amendment 1 that fights against the discrimination that would be involved with applying the policy of competitiveness and excellence in an exclusive manner .
Madam President , I would like to join in the congratulations that our speaker , Mr. Böge has received , since he has been able to launch a very clear message , to the Commission and to the Council , about what this Parliament wants .
How much money are we willing to spend on the European project ?
What kind of financial effort are we willing to make in constructing a Europe at the time at which Europe is going through hard times , where it finds itself at a crossroads ?
The speaker proposes less than the Commission , but more than the Council has proposed to us this afternoon .
The acting President of the Council says that there have to be balances .
I would underline what Mr. Elles has said  : balances yes , but remember that a Council with less money does not make more Europe , it makes less Europe at the time that we need to support this project .
The referendums that have been held during these days , and which have been commented on a lot in the speeches , remind us of the need to focus on the genuine needs of citizens , and those who want to grow faster .
This is why it is necessary to create more jobs , we have to be more productive , it is necessary to spend more money on investment , on research and development , in short , on setting the Lisbon reforms underway .
And money is needed to do this .
Our citizens have also reminded us that they also believe in a social model where both membership and market efficiency prevail .
Without a policy of correcting territorial imbalances , it is likely that the economic project that the European Union represents can be replaced . What cannot be replaced will be the political project that is in play here .
We have to convince our citizens that together we are able to face up to the challenges of the future : to the challenges of globalisation , of competition from developing countries , of the de-localisation of companies and of the ageing of the population .
And more money is needed to do this .
As an additional and final point , I declare my whole-hearted opposition to the commencement of the co-financing of the agricultural policy , because this would also mean breaking the rules of social cohesion on which the model that we believe in has been founded .
Mr. Matsakis , what you have just presented is not a question on the agenda , but rather a statement .
Following the agenda we will now move on to the declarations of the Council and of the Commission - Preparation of the European Council , including the future of the European Union following the referendums on the European Constitution ( Brussels , 16 and 17 of June , 2005 ) .
Mr. President , Mr. Acting President of the Council , Madam Commissioner , colleagues , why are we complaining so much about politics having come into European life ?
We all know that politics is not a long peaceful river , it can sometimes also be an impetuous current .
I mean , firstly , that this process has to continue , because we are all equal , we all have the right to express ourselves , and even our precursors , the Swiss , have declared themselves in favour of the European Union , with a referendum in which they decided to enter into Schengen .
Secondly , a " no " is worth as much as a " yes " , but a " no " is not a right of veto , and those who have said " no " have to say what they want to do .
Do they want to carry on with us , or do they want to leave ?
They have to say it , not us .
Since I am the first speaker who comes from a country that has said " yes " by referendum , allow me to give some advice .
Firstly , in Spain we held a referendum on the European Constitution and I would like to pay homage to all of the opposition parties , which spoke about Europe and did not speak about our domestic problems .
Secondly , it is necessary to speak about Europe , and it is necessary to speak well .
As Mr. Zapatero said in the campaign , speaking well about Europe is a weapon of mass construction .
We were clearly grateful for the " Marshall Plan " that came to us from Europe and we have tried to generate hope .
Because there were plenty of problems and complaints here , but our duty is to generate hope and answers to peoples' problems , not to complain .
I have to say that , of course , it will be necessary to reflect on what needs to be done , but we do not stop ourselves .
If we stop ourselves , the " no " syndicate will say that it has won and this is a risk that we cannot accept .
I conclude by telling the acting President of the Council to add two things to his list : it is necessary to defend the euro and it is necessary to work actively on the Ronda de Doha , which is where globalisation is going to be debated this year .
Mr. President , today 's speech is not gratifying or easy for me .
I have reflected a lot on what my Group 's position should be , and what the position of this Parliament should be concerning the ratification process .
I believe that Europe has always gone forward on the basis of consensus .
I declare today -and it has been said here- , that despite the fact that there are ten Member States that have ratified it , despite the fact that there is a large number of Europeans who have said yes to the Constitution , there is no consensus for moving forward .
I assert that it is not the text of the Constitution that should be debated , but rather the political context .
Therefore , I believe that the worst thing we could do is no see the reality with our own eyes and not concentrate ourselves on what people are asking for .
People are asking us to listen , to debate , for there to be dialogue .
I believe , today the same as yesterday -maybe with greater force than yesterday - , that the Constitution is necessary for Europe ; and since I believe it is necessary and it has to be saved , then the most logical thing -this is the position of my Group , the PPE-DE- is for ratification to be postponed .
I believe that if the Heads of State and of Government take a unanimous decision in this respect , this will give us all some time -maybe one year till the end of the Austrian Presidency- to think about what it is we are doing with the Constitution , how do we explain these things to people , how do we get back in touch with them .
In these times , in these difficult , thankless times , this is when we appreciate the soundness of people and when we must not " lick our finger and look where the wind is blowing from " , but rather do what we believe is most useful so as to be able to put what we believe necessary into practice .
I believe that the Constitution is necessary .
And this being a difficult situation , being a painful decision , my Group , which has reflected with serenity , believes that this postponement option is the best one at these times .
I would like to welcome Mr. Voronin , President of the Republic of Moldova , together with the delegation accompanying him .
Colleagues , as you know , when Rumania becomes part of the European Union , Moldova will be a direct neighbour of our Union .
This is why , Mr. President , the Union is working actively in order to deepen relations with Moldova , as I have had the opportunity to say before .
The action plan between the European Union and Moldova , which we have recently set underway , is a good tool for making progress in these relations .
Mr. President , I wish you a fruitful visit to our Institution .
The next point is the voting session .
Are you invoking section 100 on the interpretation of the Regulations ?
Wait one moment please .
Mr. Bonde , by invoking section 100 , you do not have the opportunity to speak .
It does not make reference to any point of order .
Fine , Mr. Bonde , tell me what problem you have with section 100 .
Thank you , Mr. Bonde .
I declare that it has nothing to do with a motion of order .
Please , sit down .
Don 't get into parliamentary filibustering with me .
What you are raising has noting to do with a point of order .
We have properly taken note of your observations , which will be inserted , clearly , into the text to be put to the vote .
Let me say a few words to you on the importance that the vote has for this Parliament in this decision .
We are all aware that in the coming days , the European institutions have the serious responsibility of reaching agreement on the priorities of the Union for the coming years and of providing the financial resources necessary to do this .
Parliament holds a position , which we have just voted for by a large majority .
During the debate that we held yesterday , President Barroso declared to us that , in spite of some differences , he feels comfortable with Parliament 's proposal , and so what we have just voted for now , and what the Commission is proposing , are not too different .
I believe the Member States should do everything in their power to reach agreement on June 16 and 17 next , and I believe we can have confidence in the effort being made by the Luxembourg Presidency .
Minister Schmit has also voiced the opinion that the Parliament 's vision is a test of realism and consistency .
I believe that we are in a position to ask to Council to also hold tests of realism , ambition and consistency in order for the European Union to continue functioning .
To conclude , everyone should be aware that if there are no financial forecasts , the Union would function on the basis of the annual budgetary procedure laid down in article 272 of the present Treaty , which grants Parliament very significant room for manoeuvre .
Parliament would use this , but since this could give rise to conflicts that we do not want between the two branches of the budgetary authority , we again invite the Council to reach an agreement that this Parliament can take on board .
Mr. President , like my colleagues , I think that -- in the same way as happens with the European Union --if the United Nations did not exist , it would be necessary to invent it .
This is a fact .
And it is also true that , as is the case with the European Union , it is necessary to review the United Nations .
In the specific case of the United Nations , it is clear that a profound and immediate reform is urgently required , fundamentally because the Member States are nowadays being subject to a double restriction , firstly of a budgetary nature , and secondly of a political nature .
The reports from the senior level panel and from the Secretary General , Kofi Annan , are , in my judgment -- and on this point I agree with Mr. Laschet --an excellent starting point for analysis and debate . This is why I also urge the Commission and the Council to take them sufficiently into consideration .
It is important to remember the " no to the war " street demonstrations and , above all , those that led us to doubt the importance of the war in Iraq .
I believe that at these times , when global military spending has now reached the level of one billion dollars per year and , at the same time , States are not providing money for the millennium goals , this form of re-approach is more necessary than ever .
Mr. President , I would firstly like to thank the speaker , Mr. Laschet , for the work carried out .
It is hard to achieve a broad consensus between the different groups and delegations on a matter as complex as the reform of the United Nations .
This reform deals with many important topics .
I will basically restrict myself to three aspects .
Firstly , the need for effective multi-lateralism for tackling the problems of the international community .
Not one single country or one single group of countries can say everything about it . It is instead necessary to have a multi-lateral focus , and multi-lateralism requires representative and effective institutions .
The importance and need for the reform of the United Nations follows from this .
In second place is the reform of the Security Council of the United Nations , an essential body for the maintenance of peace and of international security .
It is necessary to increase its representativeness and to improve its functioning , but it does not seem to me that the best solution would be the so-called " model A " , that is , extending the number of permanent members , a concept that appears to be somewhat anachronistic to me .
One essential objective , clearly contained in Mr. Laschet 's report , is for the European Union as such to be present on the Security Council of the United Nations .
This objective is fully consistent with the idea of a common foreign and security policy , and this will be even more the case if the Constitutional Treaty comes into force .
Of course , if the model that is ultimately successful in New York is that of the new permanent members , then in my opinion , the new seat should be for the European Union .
Incidentally , it draws my attention that , when speaking so much about common foreign and security policy , or about a future Ministry of Foreign Affairs , it is surprising that this subject has not been debated in the Council of the Union ; the presence of the European Union on the Security Council of the United Nations is not being debated in the Council , and it seems to me that the Council representative - I don 't know if he is listening to me- has not made any reference to the matter either today .
By the way , given the importance of the reform of the United Nations Organization , and of its Security Council in particular , in my opinion this should be approved on the basis of the greatest consensus possible .
A reform of this scope should only go ahead with a two-thirds majority , because otherwise it is not reasonable .
Greater consensus is necessary .
Thirdly , I welcome the significance that the report gives to the fight against terrorism and , in this respect , I do not only highlight Resolution 1373 , but also the importance of the attention to the victims of terrorism .
Resolution 1566 has already taken the first step in this respect .
It is necessary to continue improving and going deeper along these lines .
Mr. President , with this report - which I have had the satisfaction of being a speaker about - we have the opportunity of finally moving ahead with a fisheries management system for the Mediterranean , eleven years after that first attempt to bring order through the Regulation on technical measures , Regulation no. 1696/94 .
This is hence a crucial time for the fishing sector in this region , and having reached this moment , I must state my full recognition for their services to the Commissioner Joe Borg and the Director General Jörgen Holmquist -who have been personally involved in moving this dossier forward . I have worked with them day by day and , of course I must thank my colleagues of the Fisheries Commission , who have had the wisdom and generosity of relinquishing many demands from their local sectors , sometimes under strong pressure , so as not to deprive the whole of the Mediterranean sector of some common management norms .
With everybody 's involvement , we have managed to unlock the initial proposal of the Commission which was maybe made too quickly , but which opened up fronts that it seemed could not be rescued with the national authorities , with the sector and with this Parliament which , as you will recall , rejected the proposal through my colleague Lisi .
In order to get out of this impasse , I proposed that the Commission works in unison on a common text regarding the points where the conflict is greatest , so as to achieve an overall commitment , accepted by the Parliament and the Commission , which we would present to the Council of Ministers again .
The Commission accepted this method and , following very hard negotiations that lasted almost a year , this is the one that we today submit for the approval of this Chamber .
This is a text which is perhaps not as ambitious as some of us would have liked  ; maybe nobody turns out to be a one hundred percent winner .
But each one of us have given way on something so that everyone can win . This is because , if there is something we all agree on , this was of course the fishing situation in the Mediterranean could not continue being left to the judgment of a minimal form of regulation , which complicated things more than it resolved them .
If the policy consist of sacrificing particular interest in order to achieve the common good , I believe that we can be satisfied with our work in approving this report , which shows that it is easier to make progress when we work together , without overlooking the fact that when a text is presented to the administrators that is balanced and agreed upon by everyone , it is more simple for it to be accepted and so easier for it to be applied .
This work method has also enabled us to eliminate leaps in the dark that are lacking a scientific and logical basis , and some contradictions of the initial text that gave rise to the full rejection of the proposal .
Thus , for instance , a greater degree of rationality and consistency is introduced into the regulation of the depths and distances of the cost on which it is possible to work in such a biologically , economically and socially sensitive sea .
For the first time , there is regulation on dredgers , the way is opened to the more selective use of nets -such as the square net for dragging- and considerable progress is being made in making adjustments between the net and the minimum size of the species .
On the other hand , in light of the maximizing initiative of the Commission regarding closed seasons , minimum sizes and hooks for the fishing of large migratory stocks , it has been agreed that an attempt should first be made for said regulations to emanate from regional fisheries organizations , such as the CGPM and the CICAA , since these forms of fishing are also carried out by fleets from third party countries in the Mediterranean , and it is illogical to impose restrictions only on community ships .
Nevertheless , if these international bodies do not reach a settlement in the period of one year , the Commission will be empowered to submit a new proposal , since we do not wish to give up our responsibility either , which derives from these strong presences in this fishing sectors .
I would finally like to highlight , from the content of the report , the effort made for the greater protection of species through minimum sizes , with the exception -which is merely temporary- of cod . In this respect we started from a Commission proposal to reduce the size to 15 cm -which we have maintained until the year 2007 , the date on which it will recover its traditional size of 20 cm , coinciding with the increase in the net proposed .
Also , for the first time , there are regulations about the size of sardines , with the recovery of sizes that had disappeared from the Commission 's proposal , such as that for shrimps and clams , and reasonable increases in size have been included for other species . This is because the ultimate objective is , also in the Mediterranean , is to get closer to the scientific recommendations .
Mr. President , after again having requested the approval of this report from the Chamber and , above all , of the commitment agreed with the Commission , it only remains for me to await the Council accepting this new proposal in full , as the result of this commitment between the European Commission and the European Parliament .
Mr. President , I believe that , in accordance with the rules by which this Chamber is governed , the PPE-DE Group , which is the initial proponent of this resolution , should speak first .
Mr. President , Bolivia is lurching between chaos and civil war .
The collapse of the institutions of the State , the lack of authority and the disorder in the kingdom of Peace above all , makes is fear the worst , if the worst has not already been put in place .
But what has happened in Bolivia for this situation to reach such a point  ?
There are may reasons  : a succession of bad governments , the failure of neo-liberal fundamentalist policies , the desperation of the masses who are impoverished and excluded from the system , the predatory attitudes of multinationals and -this must be said- the lack of understanding or worse , the indifference of the international community .
The fact is that today Bolivia is a failed state , ungovernable and deeply unstable , whose situation could get even worse , with the solution being more difficult and costly .
I was in La Paz and Santa Cruz de la Sierra a month ago , sent by the Spanish government to assess the situation and to propose possible initiatives .
Relaying the information that I drafted , I regret that things have gone in the way that I forecast . But this is no type of merit , I am not any kind of visionary ; it was clear then , as it has been for two months , that Bolivia was falling into an abyss .
On that visit , I did not find the smallest indication of the sense of the State in the traditional parties , or in the so-called " emerging parties " or in practically in any political leader , or of a lucid and generous analysis with a view to the good of the country .
Everyone , or almost everyone calculated what suited them most  : the calling of a constituent parliament , elections for the nine prefects of the country , a referendum on the emerging autonomous regions such as that in Santa Cruz de la Sierra ...
I only found one fundamental exception at that time  : that of the President Carlos Mesa himself , I which I found a man with good intentions , who was trying to find solutions through dialogue and negotiation .
But he was and he a man alone , without a party , without parliamentary support and a varied opposition that demands solutions from him that are contradictory amongst themselves .
He only then had a high degree of popularity and a doubtless mastery of television communication .
Ready as he was -and he has complied with this- not to reproach the demonstrations and the strong streets protests , the whims of the parties and the most radical trades unions flooded the streets and they put forward their own approach .
Moreover , they have vetoed the presidency having access to the Presidents of the Senate and of the Congress , which would constitutionally be the successors of the resigned Council , and they impose the President of the High Court , the third in the line of succession , having access to the leadership of the State , but only in order to call general elections three months ahead .
Paradoxically , Mr. President , this could be the only and best democratic way out .
But maybe it is not just because the demands and calculations that are made are the most radical , but because in this way the citizens can again take on the leading role that corresponds to them and that has made them come out onto the street , because " the street " are minority sectors that are not taken account of by the immense majority of the 10 million of Bolivians .
What has the international community been doing in the meantime  ?
Not a lot .
This is why the issue has been raised from this parliament  : the European Union must be a global player  ; the European Union and its Member States are the leading investor in the help for developing Bolivia .
Because we want the governability and stability of Bolivia , and since our interests are in play , the Council must instruct its ambassadors so that Bolivia can find a peaceful and democratic way out based on freedom .
What we do want to see again is that the wealth of Bolivia , such as silver , rubber and wood , going abroad or towards the internal elite , and not for the benefit of the particular Bolivian people
Mr. President , the current situation of tension and uncertainty that Bolivia is living through is , I fear , foreseeable .
For some time we have known that broad sectors of civil society , in particular the indigenous ones , the peasants , workers and unemployed , have been marginalised from the political and economic life of the country .
However , from Europe , we cannot pretend as if we had nothing to do with what is happening .
Twenty-six of the recently privatised companies are in foreign hands , and this has not helped towards settling the crisis nor has lead to the population having greater access to gas and water .
The problem is that , from the European Union , we are constantly supporting international bodies in the privatisation process in Latin America , without having the guarantees that they meet the smallest principles of corporate social responsibility .
And what happens next ?
The companies receive credit , they invest , they want to earn money and when there are demonstrations by local groups who they have excluded and due to the rise in prices as the result of the privatisation , then the European companies decide to get up and go , taking compensation for this . This further aggravates the crisis .
For all of these reasons , if the European Union wishes to continue maintaining a certain degree of credibility , as being a guarantor of the human rights of the world , it should investigate the work of the energy companies of European origin in Bolivia and other areas , and has to be much more demanding in terms of compliance with the rules of social responsibility for the companies that invest from abroad .
Mr. President , we do not know what is happening in Bolivia now , which is undergoing the most dramatic times in its history .
The Government Palace , where the Presidency of the Government is , is well-known to the Bolivians as the " burnt palace " .
In truth , it has been burnt down several times throughout the many popular uprisings of the country .
Opposite the Palace , in the Plaza de Armas de La Paz , there is a bust of the President General Gualberto Villarroel who , in 1943 , was murdered by being hung from a lamppost , during one of the many uprisings that have taken place there .
Fortunately , according to my information from barely half an hour ago , up to now the Presidential palace has not suffered any damage , and the resigning President has just made a dramatic call to prevent bloodshed and a civil war .
I believe it is my duty to recognise , on behalf of my Group , that President Mesa has honoured his commitment never to use violence to repress protest movements and I regret that such exceptional behaviour , so unusual in a country with Bolivia 's history , has not had a response at the same level from the opposition leaders who , in my opinion , have been overcome by the events and have made their declarations more radical in recent hours .
Toady , at this time , the power is on the street in Bolivia .
When the legislators meet in Sucre , because it has not even been possible to go to the Congress headquarters in the capital , due to the blockades , the foreign embassies have activated their emergency plans for the evacuation of the country .
Today , when we are ready to vote and to approve a resolution supporting the Bolivians , appealing for respect and to the institutions and constitutional order , it is only left for me to ask that God and the Quecha and Aymar gods cast their light on the leaders and bless and protect the Bolivian public .
Mr. President , the freedom of expression and of the press is one of the fundaments on which all democracies should be based if they want to be consistent with the respect for human rights .
For this reason , the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights supports the development of plural information , as well as the strengthening of the independent media , also in Algeria .
And we must continue doing so .
In this respect , I have to say that I am concerned about the current situation of the free press in Algeria , especially following the reform of the Penal Code adopted in 2001 and , more specifically , the provisions that establish heavy prison sentences for defamation .
This is why , within the Euro-Mediterranean policy of neighbourliness and the Association Agreement , it would be an excellent gesture , on the part of the Algerian authorities , to release without delay the journalists who have been sentenced for defamation , as well as to lift the State of Emergency and stop persecuting the private Algerian media .
This would all contribute hugely towards developing and strengthening the rule of law and towards respecting the provisions of article 2 of the Association Agreement .
Colleagues , a terrible tragedy has struck the family of our colleague Filip Adwent : as you know , a traffic accident that happened on June 18th last , took his life and the life of his daughter , his father and his mother .
The Parliament has lost a colleague , a member of high quality , a member of the Agriculture and Rural Development Commission , the Vice-President of the Parliamentary Commission on EU-Ukraine Cooperation and a substitute member on the Transport and Tourism Committee .
I believe that all of you who have worked with him on these Committees and all of us in general , will remember his serious work and his dedication to the Parliament .
Filip Adwent was a doctor by profession .
He was known for his sense of justice and for the conviction with which he fought for what he believed in .
For many years he took part in the organization for humanitarian aid in Poland for the benefit of the poor and disadvantaged .
In these painful times , the Parliament wants to give an expression of its sympathy to his wife , Mrs. Adwent , and to the whole family - to what remains of his family- .
I would ask you , dear colleagues for us to observe one minutes silence in memory and rememberance of our colleague .
Colleagues , I would also like to make another statement produced by some events that have happened this weekend .
On approaching the floor , you will have seen , maybe with surprise , that there is a large white ribbon that surround the floor .
I believe that this is the first time we have used this building as a symbol for a campaign , a symbol of these dimensions , and I would like to make some remarks to you about the meaning of this white ribbon .
In short , I would like to remind you that this ribbon symbolises the " Global Call to Action against Poverty " , which was launched by the President of Brazil Mr. da Silva , in Porto Alegre , in January 2005 .
Since then , over 600 non-governmental organizations all over the world , including the most important ones , have signed up for this campaign , and they seek to gain the support of the governments of public personalities .
It is now the turn of ourselves , the European Parliament , and to do this we have selected this week of plenary sessions , which coincides with the start of the G8 summit , this coming Wednesday in Gleneagles .
Colleagues and parliamentarians , we will all agree that the fight against poverty is the aim of the Union 's development policy and this year offers a great opportunity to make progress on this , since this year is when several high level conferences will be held in this respect .
You also know that this year the European Union will contribute 46,000 million euros towards helping development , and this means that the European Union is the largest donor for this matter in the world .
There is no doubt that we can feel ourselves proud of this , but maybe we should ask ourselves what the relative size of this figure is - these 46,000 million euros- .
You could consider that the 70 euros that every European pays every year in the rich countries a development aid is equivalent to the price of one cup of coffee a week .
This is the relative dimension of our effort : the price of one cup of coffee a week for every inhabitant of the rich countries ; our generosity does not go beyond that .
The June Council approved the decision to increase the EU development aid to 66,000 million euros in 2010 , that is from 46 to 66 would be one and a half cups of coffee .
But , to do this , we would have to wait five years .
I believe that this is an ambitious message that the European Union is sending to the G8 summit this week , but we must also remember that to do this , we will need to have a budget that we do not have yet .
The goals of this campaign are fair trade , the reduction of the debt and an increase in aid , both in quality and quantity .
I would also like to remind you that outside this floor , there will be a series of small huts set up by NGOs , and that until Wednesday , you can get more information from them .
There will be a debate on Africa on Wednesday morning , concerning the challenges of globalisation , and also , of course , on this campaign against poverty , in which Jack Straw , Hilary Benn and Louis Michel will take part .
The white ribbon is the symbol of this campaign and , after the debate , all of the speakers who act in it and I myself , will , on the behalf of everyone , sign a second white ribbon as a symbol of our support ; his ribbon will be cut and Hilary Benn will take it to Gleneagles .
However , we also need the support of all of you , and this is why I ask all of you to sign the white ribbon which is located at the entrance to the floor as a demonstration of your action and of your intention to fight against poverty , in such a way that Hilary Benn can present an energetic message from this Parliament at Gleneagles .
But I would ask you , when you sign it , to take into consideration that we are citizens endowed with more powers than ordinary citizens . We are budgetary authorities , we vote on resources , we allocate means and we approve policies . Take into account , when you sign it , that in the coming years , as parliamentarians , we will have to approve the Union budget , with or without financial forecasts , and that the commitment of your signature also represents a commitment to set a real effort underway , from the power that this Parliament has , to eradicate poverty in the world .
Many thanks for your participation in this campaign .
The definitive project of the agenda of this partial period of sessions has been distributed . This was approved by the Conference of Presidents at their meeting of Thursday June 30 , in accordance with sections 130 and 131 of the Regulations .
Some proposals of modification have been presented on this agenda , and we are going to consider these day by day .
Monday : The Group of the Alliance of the Democrats and Liberals for Europe has requested that the reports from Mr. Lauk , regarding the Annual Report 2004 from the Central European Bank , and from Mr. Maaten , on the application of an information and communication strategy on the euro and the Economic and Monetary Union , be dealt with at a joint debate .
Tuesday : During the session of May 10 last , Mr. Busk 's report , on the regulation proposal concerning the exceptional measures for the support of the market , was returned to the Agricultural and Rural Development Commission , pursuant to section 52 .
Said parliamentary commission now asks for this to be returned to the commission , pursuant to sections 52 and 168 of our Regulation .
Wednesday : The Socialist Group in this Parliament has requested that the questions session to the Commission be eliminated .
Mr. Karas and 38 other members have requested that a declaration from the Commission be added about the situation in Bulgaria following the elections and the processes of Bulgaria and Rumania with a view to the coming progress report..
They are asking that progress be made towards full and effective membership , of course .
They also ask that a resolution be voted on in this respect .
Thursday : I inform you that in the course of the last two partial periods of sessions , two legislative proposals from the Commission on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs were rejected by the Plenary and they were therefore returned to said commission , in accordance with section 52 of the Regulation .
Hence with respect to the initiative from the Gran Duchy of Luxembourg with regard to the adopting of a Council resolution to adjust the salaries of Europol staff , the Commission on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs asks the Plenary to confirm the rejection during this partial period of sessions , voting on the legislative resolution that closes the consultation .
If there is no objection , the vote on this matter would take place on Thursday .
And so with respect to the motion for a decision on the preservation of data -the Álvaro report- which was returned to the Commission last June 22 , I have to inform you that said parliamentary commission would like to have more time to allow the European Commission to submit an alternative or complementary motion on the same matter .
Does it seem right to you for us to grant more time to said commission and that , once your motion is submitted , for the Parliament to then decide on the most suitable procedure for dealing with this issue regarding the Treaties ?
Let me make a specific point about what we have just voted on : it is possible to submit motions for resolution until Tuesday morning at 10.00 a.m. , and amendments and motions for common resolution can be submitted until 10.00 a.m. on Wednesday .
This debate will take place at the end of Wednesday 's agenda .
After the laborious recomposition of the agenda , we are going to move on the following point which is the one-minute speeches by the members .
I am going to continue by applying the procedure that I informed you about by letter and to which none of you have raised any objection , and which was already applied in another partial period of sessions .
Let us review the system that we are using to achieve the satisfaction of everyone , but there are a number of steps limited by the Council .
The Presidency distributes those that are available amongst the political groups .
We will study the matter in the light of what you have set out in your speech .
We thus conclude this point of the agenda .
Mr. President , I would firstly like to congratulate the two speakers , Mr. Lauk and Mr. Maaten , for the excellent work they have undertaken with their respective reports .
It seems to me that it is a wise decision for this Parliament to be able to discuss them in common this afternoon . This is because it is clear that the present and the future of the euro have a lot to with the activity and the correctness of the decisions of the European Central Bank .
Both the euro and the European Central Bank have been the subject of attacks in recent weeks .
The criticisms in the public debate are logical and positive .
If the attacks are based on a lack of arguments and , even , on demagoguery , it is necessary to give them a response .
I believe that this debate is a good opportunity to respond to some of the baseless criticisms that both the single currency and the European Central Bank have received in recent weeks .
To begin with , it is necessary to insist , as Mr. Maaten does in his report , on the advantages of the euro , on the positive aspects of the single currency since it was launched : it has provided us with stability with respect to possible monetary storms and crises , such as those we have known in the past . It has provided us with price stability , largely thanks to the correctness in monetary policy run by the European Central Bank . Thanks to this stability , it has provided us with low interest rates and protects us against risk that we should not overlook .
The euro allows us to overcome the risk that we were subject to before , but we must not forget that these risks can appear again if we do not maintain confidence in our currency and in our Economic and Monetary Union and its credibility .
It was said , on the occasion of the two referendums held in France and in the Netherlands , that part of the criticism from the " no " advocates referred to Brussels as a kind of " scapegoat " .
They were seeking to criticise elements of the global situation or the strategies of the respective national Governments , but in making these criticisms , they pointed the finger at Brussels .
My impression is that the same thing is happening with the euro and the monetary policy .
The low level of growth of European economies is not a problem of the single currency or of monetary policy ; it is principally and basically a problem of a lack of structural reforms , of a loss of dynamism , flexibility and capacity of adaptation of the European economies in a global world in which , some time ago , economic borders ceased to have the sense that they had a century ago .
Therefore , in order to get it right in proposing economic policies to our citizens on the strategies of progress , growth , welfare and employment , we cannot turn to nostalgia about the past or mistake our opponent .
The past is not going to come back and the issue is not the euro or monetary policy .
Therefore , in these difficult times that the European Union is undergoing , both from the economic and the political viewpoint , we must especially assume responsibility for making the right decisions .
I believe , as I have said on many occasions in this Parliament and outside it , that the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact , which has had very considerable support in this Parliament , is the right decision that is starting to be strictly applied , as President Trichet has just requested .
Next week we are going to debate the motions of recommendation adopted by the Commission at the Ecofin Council in relation to Italy . We are going to do this , in the coming weeks , in relation to Portugal , and we will do it in relation to other countries before the end of the year - some of the founder countries of the European Union and , also , some of the new member countries of the Union .
These rules have to be applied with credibility and energy , but at the same time , with rationality , so as not to provide arguments to those who want to contrast economic stability and budgetary discipline to economic growth and the creation of employment . This is because they are not incompatible , they are perfectly compatible .
The present Stability and Growth Pact makes it possible for this compatibility to have practical consequences in the decisions that are being adopted by the Commission and the Council .
As President Trichet has just said and as the report states , it is necessary to strengthen the dialogue with the European Central Bank , whose independence must be respected , with the Commission and with the Council , and in particular , with the Eurogroup .
I am a witness to the exception of the significant dialogue that is made very month in the Eurogroup , between the President of the European Central Bank and the ministers of Economy and Finances of the euro zone .
It is necessary to tackle a very important question that I would like to finish this speech with : the enlargement of the euro zone to the new Member States . They will be in a condition to join the twelve current members in the coming months , on strict terms and , in turn , with a wide range of views .
We are going to have to analyse the countries affected closely , honestly and with full dialogue in the coming months if Estonia , Lithuania or Slovenia -which were the first three countries of the enlargement who became part of the exchange rate mechanism in 2004 - meet each and every one of the conditions set out in the Treaty in the coming year , so as to be able to access the euro zone , as their authorities wish .
In this respect , and in relation to the information about the euro , I would like to inform this Parliament that in recent months I have begun a programme of visits to the new Member States- which will continue in the coming months from now to the end of the year . The aim is to discuss what their state of preparation is in detail with their authorities , both with their governments and with the Presidents of their respective central banks , with a view to them having access to the euro zone in due course .
We have learned a lot from the nineties to now : we can and we must convey that experience to the authorities of those countries that will one day form part of the euro zone and we can make the most of these successive enlargements of the euro zone to explain the great advantages of the euro to all European citizens -of the new and the old member countries- and to dispense with some of the false ideas that are being aired regarding our single currency .
Mr. President , Mr. President Trichet , Mr. Commissioner Almunia , dear colleagues , I value the annual Report of the European Central Bank as an example of transparency and its presentation and debate in Parliament as an exercise in democratic responsibility .
During the year 2004 , the year of the enlargement to twenty-five , the same interest rates were maintained and prices did not change with respect to the end of the year .
A situation of stability has therefore existed , but it is also a situation with little dynamism .
The economic results of the euro zone have not been in line with previous expectations : the increase in economic activity was weak in the context of the greater world growth of the last twenty years . Market share was lost in international trade and the productivity differential with the United States was increased . At the same time there were no relevant changes in the job market .
It is therefore necessary not just to undertake a reflection , but also a long commitment : sustainable growth and employment are the main concerns for Europeans .
The reform of the Stability and Growth Pact is a good response , since it replaces a mechanism with rationality .
At this time , Mr. President , we would again like the stress the special role of the Central Bank in facilitating financial conditions for everyone .
In its report , we particularly value the reference to the situation of small and medium-sized business and we would point out that , at this critical time at which it is necessary to strengthen confidence in the common project , it will continue having our support to fulfil its mission .
Mr. President , this misleading and ambiguous Directive is a dream for patent lawyers and , at the same time , a nightmare for small software businesses , consumers and freedom of expression on the net .
This is because we have a Directive rejected by over 90 % of the small software businesses on the continent .
We have a Directive for a monopoly - truly a monopoly- since this is an anti-liberal Directive .
It is a Directive that empowers the particular world of the Rockerfellers and the Morgans of the start of the last century .
It is a world that does not benefit small European companies , whose number is being increased , very often in the less developed parts of Europe , such as for instance , in Extremadura , in Spain , where hundreds and hundreds of new software companies are being set up .
These companies are threatened , as is also the case with those that are setting up in Poland and in all of the countries of the enlargement .
A lot of lies have been said here .
It has been said that we are against patents on technical software : that is not true .
We are obviously in favour when it is a question of the physical world , the forces of nature : a washing machine , a car ...
Nobody is against these patents !
But , obviously , we are against patents that really threaten the flow of information and innovation .
Many things have been said about innovation .
There has been confusion between freely patenting in an unrestricted manner and innovation , two things that have nothing to do with each other .
What we are defending is the right to develop the software , to develop the industry .
And this Directive is going to put restrictions and many obstacles in the way of real innovation on the ground in this continent which is called Europe .
I believe that we deserve a world of software , a world of business , a world for consumers , which is open to real innovation .
Mr. President , the speaker who preceeded me , Mr. Gargani , has stated his concern about the balance in the position that we adopt with respect to this motion for directive .
I believe that , necessarily , the speaker , Mr. Rocard , and Mrs. Berger , in her amendment 53 , have stressed what the goals should be in this balance , in saying that « it is necessary to carefully define the conditions for the granting of patents and the modalities that have to be respected for them , in particular with the aim of keeping the inevitable consequences of the patents systems within reasonable limits . These include creative freedom , legal uncertainty and the contrary effects on competitiveness » .
In the amendments submitted by Mr. Rocard and Mrs. Berger , there is the issue of maintaining this balance , firstly , with respect to what it is , specifically , an invention applied by computer : we are not discussing computer inventions here .
Computer inventions -computer programmes- are already protected by a community Directive from 1991 , which established the intellectual property right or , if you prefer , the author 's rights .
And this Directive is in force .
What we are talking about here is something else completely different : about the inventions that are applied or that aided , as is stated in some amendments , by computer , that is , about apparatuses that use computer programmes .
Enormous care should be taken so as not to mix one thing with the other and thus , to impede , the exercising or the development of computer-based creation .
In specific terms , amendment 50 submitted by Mr. Rocard and Mrs. Berger is very important , in maintaining the right of inter-operability of computer programmes .
The fact of a patent on some aspect of a computer programme being able to exist should not stop the free creation or the use of computer programmes to continue the development .
This inter-operability clause , which is defended in amendment 50 , is also defended in a text , which is slightly different -amendment 68 - from Messrs . Mann , McCarthy and Roth-Behrendt .
In short , in any event , it is necessary to avoid the consideration of an infringement of patent in the development , experimentation , manufacturing , sale , assignment of licences and the importing of licences that make use of a patented technique to achieve inter-operability .
In summary , the amendments submitted by Mr. Rocard and Mrs. Berger are aimed at maintaining the possibility of creation in this field and , if possible , so that projects such as for instance the LinEx project , developed by the Regional Council of Extremadura , in Spain , can go ahead for the benefit of creative innovation in the area of the European Union .
Mr. President , the first thing that we have suggested to the Transport and Tourism Commission is that , amongst the aid from the Cohesion Fund , we do not only consider the trans-European transport networks defined in the 1996 Decision , that is , those approved by the Council of Essen , but that also we include all of those identified by the high level group , the Van Miert Group , which also covers the new Member States , the coastal motorways and the GALILEO project . These are all contained in our decision from last year , 2004 .
Likewise , in relation to the areas that the assistance of the Cohesion Fund should be guided towards , we recommend that consideration also be given to the equivalent stretches of motorways or state highways that connect the trans-European highways and that includes the railway rolling stock and the collective means of transport , as well as the road infrastructure for transport by coach and bus .
And finally , we would suggest that the regulation that we are debating today does not stop the Council being able to extend the application of the Cohesion Fund , to the Member States whose wealth exceeds 90 % of the European average in an annually decreasing manner during the period 2007-2013 . This is not because they have undergone positive development in their growth , but rather for the simple statistical effect of the incorporation of new Member States with an income level lower than the usual into the Union .
IF this is not done in this way , we would be misleading ourselves .
Mr. President , I would like to begin by congratulating the speakers and , in particular , Messrs . Hatzidakis , Fava and Andria , whose work we have had the opportunity to follow closely on the Regional Development Commission , which has heard the essence of the debate .
This has been a complete example of delivery , commitment and intention to reach agreement .
I would also like to congratulate Commissioner Hübner , because his effort with moving our legislative work has helped us to overcome the lack of enthusiasm that lead to the failure of the last Council for us .
I hope that the vote of tomorrow 's Plenary is well understood by the Council as an example of the determination of the European Parliament that the cohesion policy continues being erected as an essential pillar of European integration .
In this respect , allow me to call the attention of the British presidency to this because someone could have the impression that opening very general debates -whose importance , on the other hand , nobody doubts- could end up by not concluding anything .
It is not necessary to recall that we are now out of time for the Commission to be able to develop the application programmes of the Funds in January 2007 .
If we have to wait until the spring of next year for the Council to reach an agreement , the Commission could not make the first payments till 2009 . This would be dramatic for the cohesion policy in general , and very much in particular , for the new Members States that the United Kingdom always has to be
clearly committed to .
I believe that you will know how to assess the contributions of the European Parliament , in particular the formulations for commitment for subjects as sensitive as N + 2 , VAT or the statistical effect .
The three institutions , Mr. President , have the responsibility of taking on negotiations in the coming months , with a determined intention to reach agreement because we cannot , and we should not , allow ourselves to fail again .
Mr. President , I would like to begin by repeating the congratulations to the different speakers and especially , Mr. Andria , for his work in relation to the Cohesion Fund and for the attitude of dialogue that has made it possible to reach a consensus on most of the content of said report .
From the Socialist Group we consider that this instrument is fundamental for achieving the goals of social , economic and territorial cohesion .
The insertion of measures concerning sustainable development , transport and the environment endow this Fund with consistency on the path of the European policy of cohesion .
There are issues , such as that relating to the application of the N + 2 norm , that require formulas for greater flexibility , so that setting them up does not create problems , above all , for the new Member States .
We have to point out the express reference that is made in this report to persons with disabilities , including the importance of these funds contributing to the elimination of architectonic barriers .
The achievements made thanks to this tool have made it possible for countries such as Spain to have quite acceptable levels of development ; for this reason , a sharp and immediate loss would very considerably prejudice this development .
For this reason , I would like to express my satisfaction because the need to search for a political solution for those countries that could be excluded in the future has been recognised .
With respect to the rest of the regulations , we must take account of the existence of other realities that are not exclusively the most disadvantaged regions , but also the regions of statistical effect , natural effect , outermost regions , and areas with low population density .
European reality is plural , it is diverse , and it is necessary to take account of the different realities .
A sound and successful policy on this subject must consider the different realities and not forget that behind these are the men and women European citizens , waiting for an answer .
Mr. President , I would firstly like to defend the excellent work and the difficult consensus that has been achieved by the speaker , Mr. Casa , on the Fisheries Commission of the European Parliament .
Secondly , I would also ask the critics of the fisheries structural policy what they extract from the argument that a fishing boat or an aquiculture plant are synonyms of environmental catastrophe and , by way of a change , to lend us their support .
I assure you that with the budget that is reserved for us from the European Fisheries fund -4,900 million for six years and 27 countries , which only entails an increase of 1,500 millions with respect to the current Fund for 15 countries- , we can do little harm to the environment and to the community budget .
I believe that the report has introduced more measures than those contained in the Commission 's proposal in a sensible way , with the aim of providing greater flexibility and of the Member States thus being able to provide a better response to their different sectors .
We have extended the cases for the renewal and modernisation of the fleet , because it is hard to understand why we are punishing certain professions to work with certain means of production that are obsolete and dangerous , especially the hand-crafted fleet , which is more aged .
We will subsequently lament the shipwrecks and pay homage to the victims , but this will be of little use .
But now , alternatively , we have the chance to help avoid this because , on the other hand , we already have a set of very sophisticated remote detection and satellite surveillance methods , so as to prevent over-fishing fishing what should not be caught .
Mr. President , let me have one final word with respect to mixed companies .
I believe that these are the guarantee of an effective policy of cooperation and aiding development and , in line with the thrust that has been provided to you by the Commission in the new policy of agreements of association , I would like to defend these .
However , Mr. Commissioner , I believe that is not possible for mixed companies to be able to carry on their activities in developing third countries , without the corresponding community help , since these countries do not have the same legal guarantees for investments .
Thus , if we really want mixed companies to be a pivotal point in development cooperation , Mr. Commissioner , give them help from the EFF .
Mr. President , thanks to the speakers and to the coordinators for their work  ; it has not been easy , given the situation , but they are achieving it and they deserve all of our support .
Thanks to Madam Commissioner for her efforts to understand the Parliament 's position  ; we hope that in-depth work will be done to facilitate an agreement which is as urgent as it is necessary .
To the new Presidency , which I would like to welcome from the other side of the barrier , we would ask it to demonstrate , with specific facts , its European passion that we want to believe is genuine .
But as those who govern have well known for some time , nothing exists if it is not in the budgets .
It follows from this that the first requirement for credibility , as regards the Europe that Mr. Blair seeks , is a sufficient budget delivered on time .
We also hope , both from the Commission and from the Presidency , for an acceptable level of compensation , for it to be progressive and fair , for the regions and the Member States that undergo considerable financial losses , given the new allocation of the resources for an enlarged Europe , together with preferential attention to the regions affected by the statistical effect , to those affected by the natural effect -the outermost regions- and the areas with particular structural difficulties  : the mountain regions , borders , etc. Those with de-population or a low demographic density or that are difficult to access , such as my region , Aragon .
Likewise , we would ask that the new objective of competitiveness , the one that should be re-launched by the Lisbon strategy and duplicate the effort in R + D + I , is also used to reduce the technological gap , between regions and Member States .
Whosoever believes that Europe will be able to move forward on the basis of the excellent few and a majority of digital illiterate suffers , colleagues , from complete naivety or a lack of intellectual honesty .
Mr. President , I would firstly like to thank the speaker for his summarising work , which has been visible in the amendments of commitment supported by all of the political groups .
From the text approved by the Fisheries Commission , Mr. Commissioner , I would like attention to be paid to some very positive issues and for these to be listened to closely . This is because they reflect the reality of this sector -that some of us know well because we live it day by day- , for example , that the Member States are able to submit their national plans during the whole of the scheduling period or that the article referring to equality between men and women be strengthened and this vision of equality of gender be integrated into fishing activities . Furthermore , in terms of aquiculture , we urge the extension of aid to medium-sized businesses , not just the micro-sized and small ones , and that it is possible to finance the improvement in working and safety conditions for the workers in the sector .
It is also important to attain consensus in terms of the criteria of eligibility , low employment levels and the fishing activity in decline which make it logical for the reference to municipalities of few than 100,000 inhabitants to be eliminated .
The two most controversial points , the renewal and modernisation of vessels and engines , using mixed companies as an alternative to the scrapyard , have also been settled in a positive way thanks to the great negotiating willingness that has existed .
My Group is in favour of the fleet being able to continue the renewal and modernisation process , provided that this does not mean an increase in capacity .
We have the obligation to keep the fishing activity in the European Union alive and in good health , guaranteeing a living wage and certain conditions worthy of the workers in the sector , and preserving the resources . But we also have the obligation , Mr. President , to save lives at sea .
My region , Galicia , knows a lot about this . It the last two years it has lost a lot of its people at sea , because of problems of construction , due to structural problems that the boats have .
We cannot allow this to go on happening and we have to continue supporting the renewal of the fleet .
Mr. President , Mr. Commissioner , colleagues , first of all , as President of the International Trade Commission , I would like to welcome Commissioner Kovács and inform him that we would be delighted to receive him at the International Trade Commission to hold the first discussion on the subjects that we have in common .
I say this directly to him , in this setting which is so intimate as we have right now , even at this time of the night .
I would also like to express my satisfaction and the satisfaction of my Commission for the approval of the SPG Regulation in April , even though its is regrettable that this was not adopted on the date set , so as to benefit the countries affected by the tsunami .
And , in relation to the rules of origin , while it is true that Parliament does not have the power of co-decision or of consultation with respect to the Regulation applying to the Customs Code , by virtue of a Decision from 1999 , whereby the procedures for the exercising of the competences for action attributed to the Commission are laid down , we are entitled to be regularly informed about the procedures that are carried out at committee stage .
This would mean that , as happens with the General Board of Trade , from which we specifically receive the documents from Committee 133 , the General Taxation and Customs Union Board sends us the drafts of the measures for action to the committees , together with the results of the votes and the minutes of the meetings .
This is in accordance with the competences that the Regulation confers on us , which are not strictly those referring to commercial matters , but also to economic and trade relations with third countries .
Therefore , Mr. Commissioner , we are interested and willing to consult our respective diaries in order to set out the logical lists for debate , dialogue and control of your portfolio .
As regards the content of the proposal for reform , we consider that range of issues that are raised is significant from the point of view of simplification , planning and control . I will refer to these very briefly .
As regards simplification , the elimination of a long list of conditions imposed on exporters and the extension of the certificate of origin on the basis of the criteria of added value seems positive to us .
In relation to this point , we would like to receive the impact studies or simulations that have been made in the shortest time possible . These show the economic repercussion of the establishing of added value thresholds in terms of trade exchanges and the beneficiary countries .
As far as flexibilisation is concerned , we believe that permitting regional accumulation between countries pertaining to the same region will promote economic integration amongst them . This is something that form part of our basic philosophy and could also have beneficial effects .
Finally , with regard to control , we have to make a proposal to set up new control mechanisms in such a manner that there is no accumulation of excessive bureaucratic-administrative processes that could be a disincentive to the use of the mechanisms of utilisation of preferences .
At a time at which the debate about the accomplishing of the Millennium Goals and the fight against poverty is very much alive , both in this Parliament and in the UNO , the OSCE and the G-8 , we believe that this is the most suitable time for a reform of the rules of origin that opens up our market and benefits the countries that need this most .
This is the objective of this question and we would like to know what the Commission 's criteria are at this time .
I can report to the Council and to the Commission that Parliament offers courses in modern Greek , in the case of need , so as to pronounce Mr. Dimitrakopoulos 's name more easily .
Mr. President , I would firstly like to congratulate Mr. Dimitrakopoulos for the excellent work carried out on a tough , complex and difficult topic such as that relating to Iraq , as we can see from the events that have recently taken place  : the murder of over 40 people this weekend , the kidnapping of the head of the Egyptian diplomatic mission in the street , in broad daylight , the stagnation of oil production and the spectacular worsening of the violence that has taken place in the course of the last year .
However , Mr. President , in my opinion , the task of the re-modelling , reconstruction , democratisation and pacification of Iraq is not a job that should be left to those most involved -and I am looking at Minister Straw who is with us today , who we also welcome- , but rather it is a task that should be the responsibility of the whole of the international democratic community .
Ad the European Union has to support tasks that Iraq still has to do at this time in a very determined way  : a Constitution in which the nationalist factor and the religious factor , the holding of new elections , the establishing of a new government and the trial of Saddam Hussein with prudence and in a continuous manner .
And all of this , Mr. President , has to find a place and greater participation for the Sunni community in the power structures .
If emphasis has to be placed on one aspect of the report from Mr. Dimitrakopoulos , I would put it on the support for the future that this report offers , because the future cannot be built just by narrating and evoking the preterit .
If we do not have the horizon of our ambitions and our projects for that country before our eyes , we will not be able to build the future , or even understand the past .
This is why it is very important , Mr. President , for the European Union to clearly lend its support in favour of peace , understanding , harmony and reconciliation in that country , as has been stated by Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner and as the acting President of the Council of Ministers of the European Union has also said to us .
But I believe , Mr. President , that amongst all of us we will have to try to transform the discordances of the past into the harmonies of the present , as the speaker Mr. Dimitrakopoulos , suggests to us .
We are going to move on to the joint debate on the basis of the Council 's and Commission 's declarations on Africa and the challenges of globalisation ,
as well as the oral question to the Council , asked by Mrs. Morgantini on behalf of the Development Commission : " World Call for Action on Poverty : Make Poverty History " ( B6-0248/2005 )
and the oral question to the Commission , asked by Mrs. Morgantini on behalf of the Development Commission : " World Call for Action on Poverty : Make Poverty History " ( B6-0249/2005 ) .
Mr. President , for a socialist , the eradication of poverty in the world constitutes an absolute priority , because this is an issue of justice and solidarity , both values that are in accordance with our ideological and political identity .
Justice and solidarity are part of our contribution to the process that has lead us to the European Union , but in the globalised world in which the Union has to operate , justice and solidarity cannot be considered for the exclusive benefit of our citizens and our territory .
On the contrary : it is time for justice and solidarity to transcend our borders and have an effect on all European policies and measures in the international setting , as set out in the Constitutional Treaty .
The socialists of the Development Commission are to be congratulated for two facts that relate to what we have been seeking , from this commission .
The first one is that the Council of Ministers meeting on Development in May confirmed significant commitments with a view to making the Millennium Development Goals a reality , maintaining these on the terms set down five years ago .
The second is the priority granted by the British presidency to the eradication of poverty , with special emphasis on Africa .
This seems to be justified to us , but the fight against poverty cannot be excluded in other zones of the planet in which there are huge pockets of misery and in which the inequalities are even greater than on the African continent , that also require our priority action .
With this event at hand , with this debate and with the resolution that we will approve , we are getting in tune with what millions of male and female Europeans are during throughout the Union these days .
We have recently commented on the lack of common ground existing between European bodies and leaders and our citizens .
This mobilisation against poverty is now an excellent opportunity for a matching up , a coming together and reconciliation , but watch out !
The effect will only be positive if we do not let down the trust that has been placed in us , going beyond words and good intentions .
With respect to the eradication of poverty , we will be judged by what we doing after this , and sooner rather than later , than by what we say here and now .
Mr. President , a quarter of a century has passed since Willy Brandt presented his report on North-South relations .
Since then , the poverty problem has not only not been solved , but in many cases it has also worsened .
In reality , the latest report on poverty in the world shows that there is only a certain degree of progress in China , in some countries of south-east Asia and in some specific case in Latin America .
In Africa , the data are disheartening , and so this British initiative is to be welcomed . It is not opportunist in my opinion -it was already announced , at least two years ago , by Minister Straw and by their Prime Minister- .
After 40 years , dozens of wars and millions of dead , the African continent has been left exhausted .
There are no magic recipes in the fight against poverty and we only have two certain facts  : firstly , poverty , contrary to what some people think , is a political rather than an economic problem , and as a priority , its solution requires political decisions . Secondly , in order to have success it is necessary to ensure economic growth -without growth , there is no wealth to share out .
From this point on , we are hearing million of voices these days , all over the world , asking for the application of classic recipes  : increasing official aid for development , condemning debt and for fair trade .
They are three necessary but insufficient measures .
The political and social leaders of the countries that are victims of poverty must demand a lot more , especially as regards the strengthening of civic society -of their societies- transparency and good government . In this way there can be an increase in health , education and gender policies .
In Africa , there are over 100,000 armed children , some of whose faces have become known to us .
If we want to make progress in the goal of reducing poverty to half by 2015 , these points that I have stated are on the lines that will lead to success .
Mr. Minister , your time is not limited .
You can speak for as long as you like .
The problem that is that I was calling the attention of the members for the Plenary to please remain silent .
It may be that you have not attended the debate but , please , when you join it , I would ask that you do so in a way that does not cause disturbance .
Many thanks , Mr. Benn .
I apologise to you for having had to interrupt you several times .
Thank you , Mr. Schulz , for assisting the Presidency .
Before the turn is passed to the Commission , I am going to ask everyone to be seated .
The members who are still in the corridor dealing with their personal business will be invited to leave the floor by the ushers .
Ushers , ask the members who are still in the corridor to leave the floor !
Mr. Tannock , on the basis of which article do you request the right to speak  ?
Would you be so kind as to be seated and stay quiet , please  ?
You are extraordinarily unsettled today .
Let me tell you that your attitude with respect to the subject we are dealing with this morning is shameful .
Could I ask all of the members who are wandering around the corridors to be seated or , at least , not hold conversations that disturb the order of the work ?
Mr. President , China effectively plays a fundamental role , both in foreign policy and in European trade policy .
This is why , specifically , it is so important for the European Union to be sure that its policy related to China contributes towards improving social , environmental and human rights standards , and that it does not endanger stability and regional security .
In this context , I agree that some of the actions that the Chinese authorities have recently played a leading role in , such as for example , in relation to Taiwan , the anti-secession law , have been concerning .
It is also necessary to recall that the European Union will only be able to accept an agreement between China and Taiwan if it is the result of peaceful dialogue between the parties , if it is respectful of the democratic progress made by Taiwan .
On the other hand , as has also been said , with respect to the arms embargo , it has to be remembered that it is necessary to keep this intact , at least until there is a significant advance in the situation of Tibet , until what happened at Tiananmen has been sufficiently clarified , and above all from my point of view , until the Code of Conduct of the European Union becomes a legally binding text .
This is why I would like to urge the Council representative to make us happy this August with the adopting of a legally binding statute for the Code of Conduct , which would be very much celebrated by this Chamber .
Mr. President , before commenting on the characteristics of this scheme , I would like to express my thanks not just to Mrs. Isler Béguin , but also to Mrs. Lienemann , to the speakers in the background and to the civil servants and advisors who have been working very much for consensus to be reached on this project .
The unanimity that we have achieved on the Commission on the Environment , Public Health and Food Safety was extraordinary : everyone has put their viewpoints in and even though , apparently , there are not many amendments , a new spirit has been introduced , the LIFE programme has become enriched , in cooperation with the Commission .
And how has this been enriched  ?
In my opinion , we have introduced several new aspects .
Firstly , in this project there has been a great deal of insistence on the management of natural resources .
This project has great pedagogic importance for teaching how to govern and manage the environment .
Moreover , there has been an insistence on the institutional presence , that is , the municipalities and the regions and local authorities which specifically have to re-evaluate the resources between them .
And , in this respect , I would also like to highlight another element  : the introduction of landscapes worthy of respect that were not integrated into the Natura 2000 list , along with some rivers , but which could be significant shared spaces .
And there is another new feature : the concept of international projects and cross-border projects has been introduced and the idea has been strengthened .
Why ?
Precisely because natural spaces are usually in border regions , in high-mountain regions  ; the case of rivers is very clear , the logical thing is that some day a LIFE of a river can be undertaken , because rivers cross many countries .
On the other hand , I have to say something else  : we have created a market spirit for Natura 2000 .
We consider that , in this case , it is necessary to imitate the United States policy in the creation of wetland areas , natural park areas , in such a manner that the States can compensate the owners , creating a space -we would say- for the exchange of ownership for the Natura 2000 zone .
And , in this way , businesses and many others have to take initiatives about the territory . They will contribute financially so as to compensate , on the principle of « he who pollutes pays » , for their passage through these territories that are protected by active , positive policies for preserving the environment , financed from private entities and from the institutions .
This is therefore not just one more LIFE programme , it is a scheme based on consensus that is guided , I believe , by great common sense  ; for this reason I congratulate everyone .
Mr. President , dear colleagues , today my Group feels quite proud and happy with the report that the speaker , Mrs. Isler Béguin , has handled so well , as well as all of those who have enriched it with their good work .
Co-decision is our strength and this is inspired by the need for the environmental goals that the European Union has always sought as a priority to be fulfilled .
With this report , we are not asking for something impossible regarding the resources for the Natura 2000 network .
The Commission is not more conscious than this Parliament of the difficulties that the financial forecasts produce for us , but if you want me to tell you the truth , it seems to me that there are solutions that can be reached through good intentions and decisions , as in this case .
Maybe an increase in financing for the network should also be accompanied by a greater re-distribution of the necessary resources .
In this way , Mr. Commissioner , they do not have to « pay fair for sinners » .
To provide one example , we cannot keep on asking Andalusian rural agents to tighten their belts even further , both for the maintenance of the network from the point of their legitimate responsibility as farmers , and for every specific and necessary actions , such as the preservation of the Iberian lynx .
The Commission will recall better than I do the expectation with which the Natura 2000 network was set underway .
From that time we have seen a hopeful process with legislation and programmes that made our environmental priorities a reality .
All of the investment of resources and expectation cannot be left to fall away now .
LIFE + has to be a powerful guarantee for the maintenance and strengthening of what we have constructed up to now , also with respect to the habitats and our species .
In this respect , and without casting doubt on the legitimacy of the co-financing , nobody can deny that the maintenance of the network involves -as it should- high costs for some members and , in particular , for Spain .
My country , along with Denmark possesses the largest amount of protected surface area and , moreover , 29 % of this area is located in my community , Andalusia .
Sometimes , Mr. Commissioner , it is necessary to make efforts , gamble and be brave .
I encourage you to keep on investing in the protection of the environment .
It is worth the trouble .
Mr. President , I am grateful to Mrs. Saïfi for the work carried out in this report .
What we are proposing to the Plenary today expresses concern about the difficult situation that the European textile sector is experiencing and , furthermore , considering specific measures so that it is possible to tackle the huge challenge that it is facing .
Firstly , we believe that demanding reciprocity is essential .
That is to say , we would like some rules of play that are equal for everyone , transparency in access to markets and respect for all social and environmental rights .
However , secondly , we would ask for specific support to speed up the re-structuring of companies : in order to gain competitiveness and to guarantee their future in the new global setting .
We are doomed to a re-structuring of the sector , which must be driven at all levels , the European , state and regional , and will need to be based on social and institutional dialogue .
We need to solve the background problems through a modern industrial policy .
For this reason , this Resolution asks the Commission and the Member States for a strategic European textile and garment-making strategy aimed at improving the processes that add quality , to make innovative and technologically-advanced products , to grant special importance to trade marks , to increase efforts in the sector , to include techniques from the new economy and ongoing professional training .
In order to meet these goals , it will be necessary to have a European textile plan that considers help for re-structuring and specific resources within the framework of Union funds .
Two instruments must make a decisive contribution to taking on the future in the sector  : the Launching of a European technological platform that will make it possible to create a coordinated strategy in the field of research , and for the sector to gain access to the seventh framework Programme , in accordance with the characteristics that are particular to it , such as the large presence of smes .
The European textiles sector is recognised all over the world for its quality and their design . It has demonstrated its capacity for adapting and now , if it receives the urgent support it needs when faced with the profound changes that need to be tackled , we will be able to proclaim that it will have a future .
Mr. President , I would firstly like to thank Mr. Freitas for the job he has done as the speaker , which I rate as being very satisfactory .
And I would also like to thank the Commission of our Union for the work it has been doing for the benefit of the outermost regions .
I believe that Mr. Michel has said it in a very clear way .
This is a question of the history of a success  : during the last 14 or 15 years , the outermost regions have benefited from special treatment with these programmes -Poseidon , Poseima and Poseican- which have made it possible for four million citizens , established on islands distributed around the world -in the central Atlantic , in the Caribbean and the Indian Ocean- , to have a dignified way of life that is compatible with their needs . Some regions that previously were exporters of people are at this time maintaining their populations and , in some cases , even importing them .
That is to say , there has been an evident improvement in living standards in these regions .
And this has been done with quite a reasonable process , which consists on the one hand of making it possible for surplus farmers from the rest of the territory of the Union to enter our territory and even , allow for the importing of products from other parts of the world . On the other hand , there is a restriction against these imports , necessary to maintain living standards , finishing off agriculture and other elements of the local economy .
The proposal that the Commission presents to us now is aimed at making the system we had flexible .
As Mr. Commissioner has said , it was necessary to take 56 micro-measures that were not really adjusted to the nature of this type of organization .
The amendments that the Commission on Agriculture and Rural Development is submitting are aimed at making the mechanism flexible and must also be positively welcomed .
I would like to point out -perhaps , for those who do not know the situation- that what justifies these special measures and this flexibility of the outermost regions is their complete inability to compete in the Union 's markets . That is to say , aid to the farmers of the Canary Islands or Reunion or Madeira or the Azores is not in any way going to have a detrimental consequence for the rest of the European Union . This is because the conditions of concurrence are equal . On the contrary , I would say that that they are going to facilitate development of the particular economy in the rest of the Union , as some markets have a certain acquisition level that can benefit the whole of the European Union .
Therefore I hope that this Chamber approves the report from the Commission on Agriculture and Rural Development by a very large majority , and that these measures continue working for our benefit and for the rest of the territory of the European Union .
Mr. President , we are today discussing a Regulation that will pass unnoticed amongst the serious problems that now concerns us in the Union , but which are of essential importance for the agricultural sectors of the outermost regions and , in many cases , are a question of survival .
I would basically like to highlight two aspects about the project that we are discussing : the maintaining of the financial fact sheet which was approved in the last reform of the year 2001 , which is no small thing in the times that we are experiencing  ; and secondly , the de-centralisation of the administration that grants the regional authorities the power to introduce the necessary flexibility in accordance with the needs of the agrarian sectors at any time .
That is to say , there is no plan to insert changes in the intensity of the aid , but it does have a more flexible instrument in terms of administration , as my colleague Duarte Freitas points out in his amendments 4 and 21 .
Amendment 27 from the speaker seeks to provide legal coverage to the importing of C sugar into some of the outermost regions , especially the Azores , the Canary Islands and Madeira ; this is not an issue lacking obstacles , but I hope the Commission can analyse it and understand it so as to find the most opportune solution .
During his speech , Commissioner Michel made a statement that is elliptical within what is politically correct , to the administration of the specific arrangements for supply on the islands -I am referring especially to the Canary Islands- .
Believe me , Mr. Michel , Canary Islanders would like both the local authorities and the Commission 's services to guarantee the highest level of transparency in the administration of the SAS , of this specific arrangement of supply to the islands .
Mr. President , on a visit that we made to Guatemala some months ago , we were able to see the precarious times that Guatemala , and in particular the peace agreement , are undergoing .
Many of the people that we met with declared their concern in light of what they consider to be the replacement of the peace agenda , which is still unresolved , by an emerging economic and trade liberalisation agenda .
In this context , the vulnerability of numerous groups is well-known and therefore , worrying .
Amongst the groups most affected by this situation we have to point out the indigenous groups , the social movements and defenders of human rights and , as the resolution that we are debating and voting on today states , women and children- especially the poorest ones .
First example : according to the Unit for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders of the National Human Rights Movement , 76 attacks on defenders of human rights were counted between January and May , a figure that covers unlawful entry to centres , attacks and murders .
During our visit , several of the groups assaulted and threatened contacted us to speak of their experiences .
Similarly , they lamented the impunity with which , in their opinion , those responsible for these facts are benefiting , due to the lack of investigation on the part of the authorities .
Second example : the data on the structural and direct violence that Guatemalan women suffer are alarming , but the legal and legislative responses seem to be insufficient .
Irregular forms of adoption and forcibly-imposed pregnancies or the theft of children are no more than one symptom , amongst others , of the weakness of Guatemalan Rule of Law , especially in relation to poor women and indigenous communities .
For all of these reasons , it is necessary to urge the Commission that -in the future strategy of the European Union in relation to Guatemala 2007-2013 , the following be established as the priority principles  : social cohesion , the right to food , rural development and the reform of the ownership and land use system .
It is furthermore necessary that the preparation of the strategy has the fullest possible participation of the groups concerned .
Only by involving the different parties in the process will it be possible to guarantee that the undertaking of the strategy has the local support needed in order for its objectives to be successful .
Mr. President , during the recent visit a delegation from this Parliament made to Guatemala , one fact caught our attention and that of the five colleagues , from different political groups that made it up . We agreed that the adoption of children in Guatemala by foreign families entails a problem of huge proportions , involving a blatant violation of childrens' rights and it is , in short , the object of a very big business .
According to the official figures we obtained there , in 2004 , 3,824 Guatemalan children were the subject of international adoptions , and that figure , for a country of little more than twelve million inhabitants , shows something is going badly wrong there .
Adopting a child involves a payment of between 25 , 000 and 30,000 United States dollars and of this figure , the donor mother receive barely 2 or 3 % , that is , less than 400 euros .
This means that the full amount obtained from this phenomenon of mass donations to the second largest line of business of the whole of the exportations from the country .
In general terms , they are children of single mothers , many of them girls of between 13 and 14 years old , largely indigenous , and victims of drugs and / or prostitution in many cases .
Numerous governments of Guatemala have tried in recent years to ensure the passing of a law that implements the Hague agreement with respect to adoptions , but they have been unsuccessful .
The Congress of Guatemala , surely subject to external pressures , has not been able to pass this law .
Now , the Guatemalan government expects that a law can be passed in the coming weeks that brings an end to this situation . This is why my Group is sending a very clear message to the authorities of Guatemala , telling them that they have all our support in order that their Congress can finally approve a law , which brings order to this situation which is truly intolerable .
