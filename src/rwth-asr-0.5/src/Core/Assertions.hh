 * @subsection faq Two FAQs for the extremely impacient:
 *
 * - Q: I get a precondition violation in somebody else's code. Why?
 *   A: A recondition violation is caused by a require() statement.
 *   The meaning of such a statement line require(foo) is: The
 *   function must not be called unless the expression "foo" is
 *   true.  The caller is obliged to satisfy "foo", the callee may
 *   rely on this.  So a precondition violation means, there is a
 *   bug in your (or some intermediate) code.  Find it and make sure
 *   "foo" holds.
 *
 * - Q: I get a postcondition or assertion violation in somebody
 *   else's code. Why?
 *   A: The kind of violations are caused by
 *   ensure(), verify() and defect() statements.  They all state
 *   some proposition by the author about the correct functioning of
 *   his code.  If any of them fails, the author has made an error
 *   and it's time to fix this.
 *
 * @subsection dbc Design by Contract
 * Now to some more thorough explanation:
 * (Most of the following material is based on chapter 11 of "Object
 * Oriented Software Construction, 2nd ed." by Bertrand Meyer, which
 * is quite rewarding to read.)
 *
 * @subsubsection bugs What is a bug?
 *
 * - An @em error is a wrong decision made by the developer or user.  An
 *   error during development leads to a defect (see below).  An error
 *   by the user leads to a failure.
 *
 * - A @em defect (often called bug) is a property of the program code,
 *   causing the executable to deviate from its intended behaviour
 *   (so-called failure).
 *
 * - A @em failure (aka runtime error) is an event of the program
 *   deviating from its intended behaviour.  Failures may be caused by
 *   defects, user errors or exceptional events (e.g. disk full).
 *
 * - An @em assertions is a proposition about the correct behaviour of
 *   the programme.  If an assertions does not hold this indicates the
 *   presence of a defect.  It is wrong to use assertions to state
 *   anything which is not knowable at compile time.
 *
 * @subsubsection prepost Preconditions and Postconditions
 *
 * The basic idea is to view the relation between classes as a
 * client-supplier releationship.  The interface of a function or
 * class is a contract between these parties, which states their
 * mutual obligations.  The obligations of the client, i.e. the
 * caller, are called precoditions; they must be satisfied before the
 * function is called.  The supplier, i.e. the called function,
 * benefits from its preconditions, because it may rely on them.  The
 * obligations of the callee are called postconditions; they must be
 * fulfilled when the function returns.
 *
 * Preconditions and postconditions are two types of assertions.  If
 * under any circumstances an assertion does not hold, this indicates
 * a defect.  Therefore it is very useful to test all assertions
 * during program execution.  To declare a precondition, use the
 * require() macro; to declare a postcondition, use ensure().  Other
 * assertions can be declared using verify().  Conceptually pre- and
 * postconditions are part of the functions interface, but in C++ we
 * can only embed them in the function code.  Function argument types
 * and return types can also be considered pre- and postconditions
 * respectively, but they are checked statically by the compiler.
 * require(), ensure() and verify() all take a boolean expression as
 * argument and abort execution immediatelly with an error message,
 * when it evaluates to false.
 *
 * @warning Remember that assertions must NEVER have SIDE-EFFECTS.
 *
 * The use of assertions resembles a formal proof of correctness:
 * Precoditions (require()) correspond to the presumptions, verify()
 * assertions denote the intermediate steps of the proof, and
 * postconditions (ensure()) state the proposition to be proved.
 *
 * @subsection performance Performance Issues
 *
 * In an ideal world where computers are infinitely fast, we would
 * check all assertions all the time.  However in the real world we
 * cannot afford to do that.  But not checking them would defeat their
 * purpose and their benefits (especially quick detection and spotting
 * of errors).  As D. Knuth (supposedly) put it: "Switching off checks
 * in a production version, is like wearing a life jacket on the
 * shore, and leaving it behind when going to the sea."  In consequence
 * Sprint adopts a three way build system:
 * - the release verion checks no assertions at all.  Maximum speed,
 * maximum risk
 * - the standard version checks most assertions, except for those incurring
 * a significant performance penalty.  High speed, moderate risk.
 * - the debug version checks all assertions all the time, but may be
 * horribly slow.  No risk, no fun.
 *
 * Normally you should use the normal require(), ensure() and verify()
 * macros.  If you find, that they slow down you program significantly
 * (by more than 1% as rule of thumb), use the underscore versions
 * require_(), ensure_() and verify_(), which are only checked in the
 * debug version.
