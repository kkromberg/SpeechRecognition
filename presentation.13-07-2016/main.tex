Basic setup:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lexicon consists of 106 states
  \item Exact computation of the linear segmentation
  \item Maximum approximation for GMMs
  \item 6 EM steps
  \item 4 density splits
\end{itemize} 
\vspace{20pt}
Tunable properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimum observations per density
  \item Pooling type
\end{itemize}
\vspace{20pt}
Tuning is based on the likelihood of the training data

\NewPage\headline{GMM Tuning: EM Parameters}
\vfill
Pooling:
\begin{itemize}
	\item No pooling results in better model fitting than using pooling 
	\item Global and mixture-level pooling perform similarly 
  \item Due to the size of the data, there is little reason to use pooling
\end{itemize}
\vspace{20pt}
Splitting criterion:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Minimum number of observations per density has a small influence
	\item Sufficient data points per density in a mixture due to:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item At most $5$ densities per mixture
		\item Each density has, in average, $7$K data points.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\vfill

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\NewPage\headline{GMM Tuning: Alignment Parameters}
\vfill
Tunable parameters (optimized on the best performing EM setup):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Time distortion penalty (TDP) values:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Forward transitions do not have costs (to enforce monotonicity)
      \item Skip and loop transitions have differing costs
      \item Due to high number of states per word, skips should cost more
    \end{itemize}
	\item Pruning threshold
\end{itemize}
\vfill

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\NewPage\headline{Alignment Results}
\vfill
\begin{itemize}
  \item Evaluation on acoustic model (AM) score and silence ratio in resulting alignment
  \item Pruning threshold set to 200 (run with higher thresholds)
  \item TDP format (Loop-Forward-Skip) 
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{| l |  c | c |} \toprule
  TDP values & AM score           & Silence [\%]      \\ \midrule

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Cheaper loop transitions results in alignments with less silence
	\item First 3 systems have similar AM scores, but differing silence ratios

\begin{itemize}
	\item Optimization performed on the first 1000 segments of test corpus
	\item Tuning: Word penalty (WP) and TDP depending on word error rate (WER)
