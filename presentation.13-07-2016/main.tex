Hardware:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Intel i5-4690K @ 3.5GHz, Quad Core, SSE2 registers
  \item 16GB DDR3 1333MHz RAM
\end{itemize}
\vspace{20pt}
Parallelization with OpenMP:
\begin{itemize}
  \item In search
  \item In neural network operations

\NewPage\headline{GMM Tuning: EM Parameters}
\vfill
Basic setup:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lexicon consists of 106 states
  \item Exact computation of the linear segmentation
  \item 6 EM steps
  \item 4 density splits
\end{itemize} 
\vspace{20pt}
Tunable properties:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimum observations per density
  \item Pooling type
  \item Maximum approximation vs. sum approach
\end{itemize}
\vspace{20pt}
Tuning is based on the likelihood of the training data

  Graph of the AM score after each split for pooling type and max approx.. In total 6 curves.
\end{center}

Remarks:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Best performance by the model without pooling and with the max. approximation
  \item Minimum number of observations per density did not influence the score much
  \item Due to a software bug, the sum approach does not work properly after the 4th split
\end{itemize}
